Meursault goes to Théo, a former night club owner, in prison for two years on false charges, who is being released in exchange for information about Montreal's underworld. Théo agrees to steal the bag for money and safe passage to the United States for himself and his son Robin. Théo brings in two helpers, Gilder, ex-con and set designer, and Roxanne, Gilder's friend, a tough-minded petty thief. Their elaborate plan blows up when a guard, Martial, takes his responsibilities too seriously.

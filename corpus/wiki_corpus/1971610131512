1971;;Family Life;;British;;Ken Loach;;Sandy Ratcliff, Bill Dean;;drama;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Life_(1971_British_film);;A young woman, Janice, is living with her restrictive and conservative parents, who lead a dull working-class life, and consider their daughter to be "misbehaving" whenever she's trying to find her own way in life. When she becomes pregnant, they force her into abortion, and hypocritically blame her for "upsetting them" when she is unable to cope with the emotional and mental effect this has on her. Janice is subjected to shockingly self-righteous and ignorant doctors.

1966;;Chappaqua;;American;;Conrad Rooks;;Jean-Louis Barrault, William S. Burroughs;;drama;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chappaqua_(film);;The film briefly depicts Chappaqua, New York, a hamlet in Westchester County, in a few minutes of wintry panoramas. In the film, the hamlet is an overt symbol of drug-free suburban childhood innocence. It also serves as one of the film's many nods to Native American culture. The word "chappaqua" derives from the Wappinger (a nation of the Algonquian peoples) word for "laurel swamp."

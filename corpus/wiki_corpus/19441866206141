1944;;Atlantic City;;American;;Ray McCarey;;Constance Moore, Stanley Brown, Charley Grapewin;;romantic musical;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_City_(1944_film);;In 1915, Atlantic City is a sleepy seaside resort, but Brad Taylor, son of a small hotel and vaudeville house proprietor, has big plans: he thinks it can be "the playground of the world." Brad's wheeling and dealing proves remarkably successful in attracting big enterprises and big shows, but brings him little success in personal relationships. Full of nostalgic songs and acts, some with the original artists.

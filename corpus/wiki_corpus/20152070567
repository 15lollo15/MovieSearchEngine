According to the official synopsis, the film will tell the "real story" of what happens when "hopeless lute player Bill Shakespeare leaves his family and home to follow his dream. It’s a tale of murderous kings, spies, lost loves, and a plot to blow up Queen Elizabeth I." [4] Writer Rickard further explained that this "very different" version of the future Bard has already tried "everything from contemporary dance to playing lute in a band. He's never found his calling."[5]

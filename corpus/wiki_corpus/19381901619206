1938;;The Great Waltz;;American;;Josef von Sternberg, Julien Duvivier;;Luise Rainer, Fernand Gravey, Lionel Atwill;;drama, musical;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Waltz_(1938_film);;The highly fictionalised story sees 'Schani' dismissed from his job in a bank. He puts together a group of unemployed musicians who wangle a performance at Dommayer's cafe. The audience is minimal, but when two opera singers, Carla Donner (Miliza Korjus) and Fritz Schiller (George Houston), visit whilst their carriage is being repaired, the music attracts a wider audience.<br><br>Strauss is caught up in a student protest; he and Carla Donner avoid arrest and escape to the Vienna Woods, where he is inspired to create the waltz 'Tales from the Vienna Woods'.<br><br>Carla asks Strauss for some music to sing at an aristocratic soiree and this leads to the composer receiving a publishing contract. He's on his way, and he can now marry Poldi Vogelhuber, his sweetheart. But the closeness of Strauss and Carla Donner during rehearsals of operettas, atrracts comment, not least from Count Hohenfried, Donner's admirer.<br><br>Poldi remains loyal to Strauss and the marriage is a long one. He is received by the Kaiser Franz Joseph I of Austria (whom he unknowingly insulted in the aftermath of the student protests) and the two stand before cheering crowds on the balcony of Schönbrunn.

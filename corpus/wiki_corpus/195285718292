When Ransome is then accused of murdering his mistress on the same night, Anne takes on his defense. In a court battle against Nigel Stewart, a barrister who is madly in love with her, Maitland clears Ransome of murder by disclosing her earlier relationship with him, and that he was staying in her flat on the night of the crime. However, when it is discovered that Ransome did commit the murder, Maitland's reputation is in tatters. But this failure leaves her finally able to marry Nigel Stewart when he is no longer a professional threat.[5]

1940;;Charlie Chan's Murder Cruise;;American;;Eugene Forde;;Sidney Toler, Marjorie Weaver, Lionel Atwill;;mystery;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Chan%27s_Murder_Cruise;;The famed detective seeks to unmask a killer on a voyage across the Pacific Ocean.As has been mentioned elsewhere, this story is primarily a remake of the (now) lost movie, "Charlie Chan Carries On," (1931) starring Warner Oland. The story has been updated to include more Charlie, but it would be nice to have the missing movie to compare against.

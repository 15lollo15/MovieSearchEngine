1938;;I See Ice;;British;;Anthony Kimmins;;George Formby, Kay Walsh;;comedy;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_See_Ice;;The farcical adventures of a prop man (George Formby) with a touring ice ballet. Inventing a new sort of candid camera in his spare time, and concealing it in a bow-tie, our hero gets into a mess of trouble when he takes an incriminating photo of an important man; pulls a communication cord; winds up in jail; referees a hockey match; finds himself in a stage show dressed as a cosack; woos an attractive young ice skater (Kay Walsh); and eventually wins a job on a newspaper.[2][3][4]

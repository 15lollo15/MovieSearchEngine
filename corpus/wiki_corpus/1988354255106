The town's rabbi dies, and a sub-plot develops in which Max's father and grandfather (synagogue leaders) are saddled with a traditional Hassidic rabbi who sticks out like a sore thumb among the otherwise assimilated Jewish community. To make matters more difficult, he likes a Catholic girl, whom he later competes with in a piano competition. The quirky, fun-loving rabbi tries to help him with his problems, yet harbors a secret ambition of his own.

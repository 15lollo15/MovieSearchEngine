1952;;My Six Convicts;;American;;Hugo Fregonese;;Gilbert Roland, Millard Mitchell;;comedy;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Six_Convicts;;My Six Convicts is the true story of a prison psychologist (John Beal) and his attempts to get through to his incarcerated patients. While dealing with serious issues, the film was created in comedic form. While the film is true to the overall spirit of the book, dramatic license was taken with the adaptation and certain events (e.g., the failed prison break and the resulting death of an innocent inmate) are fictional and were created solely to add dramatic elements to the film.

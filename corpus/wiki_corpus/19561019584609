Novak's silence exacts a toll on his wife Frances (Beverly Garland), who is expecting a child. The longer Novak remains in prison, the more he becomes aware that the mob has deserted him — and the more he's willing to spill what he knows. Fellow prisoner Steve Marlin (Ted de Corsia) intends to see that Novak keeps his mouth shut permanently.

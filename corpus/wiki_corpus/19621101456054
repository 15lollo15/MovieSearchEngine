Furie;;Richard Todd, Robert Morley;;crime;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boys_(1962_British_film);;Four youths, described frequently as teddy boys, are on trial for the murder of a garage night watchman.

Flashbacks of the teenagers' insecure and sometimes alienated lives contrast strongly with the austere legality of the courtroom as, by degrees, the truth emerges.

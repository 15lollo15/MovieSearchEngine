Its replacement is Dunderhead, a much lowlier animal, but favourite of jockey and stable lad, Albert. Meanwhile, two crooked stable hands plot to use the cross channel trip to smuggle forged bank notes in the horse’s blanket. Their plans are foiled however, by Albert, who also manages to win the big race riding his favourite horse.

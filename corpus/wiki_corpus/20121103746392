As the night draws on, Frank and the boy find themselves only deeper in darkness. Soon the lines between good and evil are no longer clear, and D begins to question if all will really be okay, come morning.<br><br>According to an article in @Urban Magazine, the story of Come Morning is completely fictional but was partially inspired by Sims' boyhood hunting trips with his grandfather.[6]

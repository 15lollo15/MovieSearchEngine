1939;;Tower of London;;American;;Rowland V. Lee;;Basil Rathbone, Boris Karloff, Barbara O'Neil;;historical;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_London_(1939_film);;The plot was not derived from Shakespeare's Richard III, but rather was written by Robert N. Lee (director Rowland V. Lee's brother) after reading a great deal of British history. George, Duke of Clarence (one of Richard's brothers) is depicted as something less than the tragically noble figure found in Shakespeare. Ian Hunter portrays Edward IV, who is not depicted here as the feeble, dying King found in Laurence Olivier's 1955 film version of Shakespeare's play.

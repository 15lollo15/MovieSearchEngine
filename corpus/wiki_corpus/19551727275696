1955;;See How They Run;;British;;Leslie Arliss;;Ronald Shiner, Greta Gynt and James Hayter;;comedy;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/See_How_They_Run_(1955_film);;In this crazy farce, Cockney corporal Wally Winton (Ronald Shiner) desires promotion so that he can finally receive an inheritance. He dresses up as a priest and goes out one night with Penelope Toop (Greta Gynt), the vicar's attractive blonde wife. To add to the theme of mistaken identity, there are several priests running around, some real, some fake. One of these, Basher (Charles Farrell), is discovered by Winton to be an escaped convict, and is placed under arrest. The corporal is then promoted and becomes eligible for his inheritance.

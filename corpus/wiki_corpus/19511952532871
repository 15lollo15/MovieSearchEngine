1951;;Duck and Cover;;American;;Anthony Rizzo;;;;propaganda;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_and_Cover_(film);;The film starts with an animated sequence, showing an anthropomorphic turtle walking down a road, while picking up a flower and smelling it. A chorus sings the Duck and Cover theme:<br><br>Under the theme, Bert is shown being attacked by a monkey holding a lit firecracker or stick of dynamite on the end of a string. Bert ducks into his shell in the nick of time, as the charge goes off and destroys both the monkey and the tree in which he is sitting. Bert, however, is shown perfectly safe, because he ducked and covered.<br><br>The film then switches to live footage, as narrator Middleton explains what children should do "when you see the flash" of an atomic bomb. The movie goes on to suggest that by ducking down low in the event of a nuclear explosion,(crawling under desks and covering their necks with clasped hands)[1] the children would be safer than they would be standing, and explains some basic survival tactics for nuclear war (facing any wall that might lend protection).[1]<br><br>The last scene of the film returns to animation in which Bert the Turtle (voiced by Carl Ritchie) summarily asks what everybody should do in the event of an atomic bomb flash and is given the correct answer by a group of unseen children.

He is assisted by a newspaper man, Jerry McKibbon, who does not think Conroy is tough enough to handle this almost impossible assignment. McKibbon finds his efforts are also compromised by political corruption. McKibbon is eventually shot down by an out-of-town assassin who was hired to kill him at a boxing match.

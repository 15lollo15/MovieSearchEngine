His profitable venture attracts the unwanted attention of the American Mafia, who attempt to secure a piece of the action by sending in two of their henchmen: the pensive, world-weary veteran Tony and his violent, not-too-bright sidekick Sal. Ryan soon finds himself fending off the trigger-happy "yanks", outback-style, while also contending with his feisty wife, needy mistress, and a crooked cop.

The relatives include his children: eldest son Johnny, a tree surgeon who wants more adventure in his life; his brother Frank, a labor leader who wants to live up to his father's expectations; their sister Tracy, a dancer; her ex-husband Boyd; an embalmer Peter, who is in love with Tracy; and a younger sister Nora, who is a nun based in Latin America.<br><br>There are unfamiliar faces too, like a woman named Cassie who turns up at the funeral and may or may not have been their late father's mistress. It is a chance for everyone to get acquainted or reacquainted, and it's all in the family.

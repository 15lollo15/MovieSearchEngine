Terence O'Malley (Sack), nephew of Squire O'Malley (Ryan), is anxious to win Peggy. Terence and his uncle have a quarrel because Terence cannot win Peggy, and the squire is killed. Terence does the killing with Neil's gun, so Neil is held for the murder. Peggy, to save her fiance, dresses as the will-o'-the-wisp, and this results in a confession by Terence.

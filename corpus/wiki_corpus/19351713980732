1935;;Once in a New Moon;;British;;Anthony Kimmins;;Eliot Makeham, René Ray, Morton Selten;;sci-fi;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_in_a_New_Moon;;When a dead star passes planet Earth, its magnetic pull dislodges the English town of Shrimpton-on-the-Sea and causes it to break away and become its own miniature globe in orbit around the Earth. The village is now an island, the only land, and the rest of the mini planet is water which can be circumnavigated in a day. Sail straight and you eventually find the town again. The sun rises and sets every few hours and the Earth can be seen as a new moon in the sky. Otherwise, life is as before.<br><br>As panic sets in, the upper and lower classes of the village set about forming a new government. However, stubbornness, snobbery, distrust, paranoia and petty jealousy soon lead the population of the newly-named Shrimpton-in-Space to the brink of civil war.

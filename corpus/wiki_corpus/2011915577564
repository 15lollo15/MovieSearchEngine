2011;;Café de Flore;;Canadian;;Jean-Marc Vallée;;Kevin Parent, Vanessa Paradis, Hélène Florent, Évelyne Brochu;;drama;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caf%C3%A9_de_Flore_(film);;The film cuts between two seemingly unrelated stories. One, set in present-day Montreal, stars Kevin Parent as Antoine, a successful club DJ torn between his new girlfriend Rose (Évelyne Brochu) and his still-complicated relationship with his ex-wife Carole (Hélène Florent); the other, set in 1960s Paris, stars Vanessa Paradis as Jacqueline, the fiercely protective single mother of Laurent (Marin Gerrier), a child with Down syndrome who has a crush on Véronique (Alice Dubois), a friend and companion who also has Down syndrome. The film builds toward the revelation of how the two stories are linked: after Jacqueline, Laurent, and Véronique are killed in a car accident, Carole, Antoine, and Rose are their subsequent reincarnations.[8]

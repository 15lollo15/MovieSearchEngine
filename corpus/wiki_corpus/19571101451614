1957;;The D.I.;;American;;Jack Webb;;Jack Webb, Jackie Loughery;;war;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_D.I._(film);;Technical Sergeant[6] Jim Moore (Webb), a tough-as-nails Drill Instructor on Parris Island, has a thorn in his side in the person of Private Owens (Don Dubbins), who seemingly has what it takes to be a Marine, but inexplicably caves in when the pressure is on. Convinced he can make Owens into a Marine, Moore pushes Owens harder, but Owens continues to falter and very nearly deserts.<br><br>After a discussion with Moore and his commander, Captain Anderson (Lin McCarthy), in which they find out that Owens had two older brothers, both Marines killed in action during the Korean War, Anderson is ready to discharge Owens, but an unannounced visit from Owens' mother (Virginia Gregg) further reveals that Owens' father was also a Marine, and was lost in battle in the Marianas during WWII; she then admits she made the mistake of coddling her only remaining son, and tells Anderson not to discharge him saying that he will never amount to anything if he doesn't make the grade. She tells Moore that her son can handle whatever he can dish out and to keep on him. Anderson later tears up Private Owens' discharge papers, and Owens is well on his way to becoming a Marine.<br><br>Barrett's screenplay expanded the play by introducing subplots of Moore having a romance with a local shop girl (played by Webb's future wife Jackie Loughery) and having Owens' mother (Virginia Gregg) make a trip to the Marine Corps Recruit Depot to beg the Corps to keep her son in order to make a man out of him.

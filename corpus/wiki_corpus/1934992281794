1934;;The Affairs of Cellini;;American;;Gregory La Cava;;Constance Bennett, Fredric March, Fay Wray;;historical comedy;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Affairs_of_Cellini;;Both the Duke and Duchess have an eye for beauty and other partners. The Duke presently fancies a young woman who poses as an artist's model. The Duchess has her eye on the famous artist, Benvenuto Cellini, who is in the palace making a set of gold plates to be used at ducal banquets. Cellini purportedly hypnotizes young women, and cuckolds the Duke of Florence. The somewhat oblivious Duke is loath to punish the young man, for Cellini fashions gold wares for him, but throws him into the torture chamber. However, a goblet of poisoned wine solves the problem.

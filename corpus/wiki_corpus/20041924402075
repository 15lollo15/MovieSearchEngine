Outwardly, he has all the signs of a successful life—large home, loving family, successful career. However, it soon becomes clear that not everything is as it appears at work. Tom consciously takes a different path and cuts ties with his normal life. He has chosen the streets, where those he meets, in spite of their position, have enormous self-dignity—the rent boy (Dan Spielman), an ex-junkie (Loene Carmen), a gentle-but-manly tramp (Bill Hunter) and a 14-year-old graffiti artist (Jarryd Jinks). Tom goes on a personal journey of his own as he plumbs outsider society, yet he discovers his own dignity and gains an understanding of who he is.

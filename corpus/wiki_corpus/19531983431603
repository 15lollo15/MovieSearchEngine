1953;;The Oracle;;British;;C.M. Pennington-Richards;;Robert Beatty, Michael Medwin;;comedy;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oracle_(film);;Timothy Blake (Michael Medwin), a British reporter holidaying in Ireland, visits a remote village where he hears a man's voice coming from the bottom of a well. The voice turns out to be a modern-day Oracle, or fortune teller, whose predictions prove uncannily accurate. Bob is determined to get a story out of this, but his editor is less enthusiastic and promptly fires him. The new found publicity though, means the once-sleepy Irish village is now invaded with curiosity seekers, and those seeking the horse racing results.

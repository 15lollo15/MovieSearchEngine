1958;;The Old Man and the Sea;;American;;John Sturges;;Spencer Tracy;;adventure;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea_(1958_film);;The Old Man in the film is a Cuban fisherman who has gone 84 days without a catch. His only friend is a young teenager whose name is Jabby who has been barred by his father from accompanying the Old Man out to sea. On the Old Man's 85th day out, he finally hooks a huge marlin, which he then tries to bring in and haul in from far out from shore. For three days and nights he battles the fish, which is portrayed in the film (as it had been in Hemingway's novella) as a trial of mental and physical courage that becomes the ultimate test for him of his worth as a man.

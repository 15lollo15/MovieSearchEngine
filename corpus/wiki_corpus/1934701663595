1934;;The Dragon Murder Case;;American;;H. Bruce Humberstone;;Warren William, Margaret Lindsay;;mystery;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dragon_Murder_Case_(film);;The movie features a large dragon illustration behind the opening and closing credits. Monty Montague disappears after diving into a natural pool of water on an estate. Several people dive in, but there is no trace of him. Philo Vance and the District Attorney come to investigate and decide to drain the pool. They are told that there were craters in the pool, and sure enough Montague's body is found at the bottom of a very deep one. His body has claw marks on it, consistent with the superstition that a dragon inhabits the pool.

1998;;Chairman of the Board;;American;;Alex Zamm;;Carrot Top, Courtney Thorne-Smith;;comedy;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_the_Board_(film);;Edison (Carrot Top) is a poor, failed inventor and surf bum, but soon runs into and befriends wealthy business magnate Armand McMillan (Jack Warden). When Armand passes away shortly thereafter, he leaves Edison the majority of shares in his large invention corporation, and leaves his jealous nephew, his only living relative, Bradford (Larry Miller) only a surfboard. Bradford attempts to derail Edison's success by stealing his formula for non-toxic glow in the dark gunk and sharing it with a consumer who covers himself in it and alleges that Edison's prize inventionâ€”a portable TV/TV dinner combo leaks radiation. When Edison reveals the truth (and proves it with another invention), the company is saved, Bradford is arrested, Grace Kosik made a deal with the company and she will testify against Brandford, and Edison appoints his girlfriend Natalie Stockwell (Courtney Thorne-Smith) to run the company.

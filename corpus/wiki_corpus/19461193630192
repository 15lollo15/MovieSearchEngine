1946;;Do You Love Me;;American;;Gregory Ratoff;;Maureen O'Hara, Harry James;;musical;;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_You_Love_Me_(film);;Jimmy Hale (Dick Haymes) is a successful singer. He chases Katharine "Kitten" Hilliard (Maureen O'Hara), a prim, bespectacled music school dean who, after traveling to the big city, transforms herself into a desirable, sophisticated lady. Jimmy isn't the only one eager to win Katharine's affections: it turns out that the smooth-as-silk trumpeter and bandleader Barry Clayton (Harry James) has designs on Katharine as well.[5]

Terribly Happy;;73;;88;;NC;;Robert (Jakob Cedergren) -- a timid Copenhagen city policeman -- is reassigned to protect and serve in a sleepy town in rural Denmark. But Robert struggles to maintain order in his new jurisdiction, a lawless place where the only rules are those dictated -- and enforced -- by local thug and serial wife-beater Jorgen (Kim Bodnia). As the indifferent townspeople dismiss Robert's laughable attempts at police work, he nurses a fixation with Jorgen's sexpot spouse, Ingerlise (Lene Maria Christensen).;;Drama,Mystery & thriller;;Henrik Ruben Genz;;2010;;Jakob Cedergren,Kim Bodnia,Lene Maria Christensen,Lars Brygmann,Anders Hove,Anh Lé,Jens Jørn Spottag,Henrik Lykkegaard,Peter Hesse Overgaard,Niels Skousen,Lars Lunøe;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/terribly_happy

Under the Sand;;83;;93;;NC;;For many years, Marie and Jean have happily spent their vacation together in the Landes region of western France. But this summer, while Marie naps on the beach, her husband goes swimming and vanishes without a trace. Tenaciously and disquietingly, Marie keeps the memory of her husband alive, often speaking of him as if he never disappeared. An offbeat study of the grieving process that will ring true for anyone who has gone through a similar personal loss.;;Drama;;François Ozon;;2001;;Charlotte Rampling,Bruno Cremer,Jacques Nolot,Alexandra Stewart,Pierre Vernier,Andrée Tainsy,Maya Gaugler,Damien Abbou;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/under_the_sand

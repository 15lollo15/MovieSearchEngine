Maria Full of Grace;;87;;97;;R;;Seventeen-year-old Colombian Maria (Catalina Sandino Moreno) is desperate: pregnant and with a large family to care for, she's forced to leave a demanding job after an altercation with her boss. Needing work as soon as possible, she encounters charming Franklin (John Álex Toro), who offers her a dangerous job as a drug mule. With cocaine pellets in her stomach, Maria flies to New York for the drug drop-off, but finds her new line of work may be far riskier than it initially seemed.;;Drama;;Joshua Marston;;2004;;Catalina Sandino Moreno,Yenny Paola Vega,Guilied Lopez,John Álex Toro,Patricia Rae,Wilson Guerrero,Jaime Osorio Gómez,Johanna Andrea Mora,Orlando Tobón,Fernando Velasquez,Virgina Ariza;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/maria_full_of_grace

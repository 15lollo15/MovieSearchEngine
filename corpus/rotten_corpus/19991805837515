Mystery Men;;57;;61;;PG-13;;Champion City already has a superhero, the appropriately named Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), but that doesn't deter the city's seven quirky amateur crime-fighters, who use the Captain's capture at the hands of villain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) as motivation to prove themselves. The only problem is that their strange powers -- silverware hurling, bowling, shovel skills, incompetent invisibility and deadly flatulence -- aren't doing them any favors.;;Fantasy,Action,Comedy;;Kinka Usher;;1999;;Hank Azaria,Janeane Garofalo,William H.

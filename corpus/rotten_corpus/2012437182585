However this time, the fur flies when Hans and Billy kidnap the beloved pooch of a gangster (Woody Harrelson), and Marty uses the ensuing events as fodder for his screenplay.;;Comedy;;Martin McDonagh;;2012;;Colin Farrell,Christopher Walken,Sam Rockwell,Woody Harrelson,Abbie Cornish,Tom Waits,Olga Kurylenko,Zeljko Ivanek,Gabourey Sidibe,Kevin Corrigan,Brendan Sexton III;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/seven_psychopaths

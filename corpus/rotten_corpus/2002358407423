Mondays in the Sun;;86;;80;;R;;Vigo, a port town in Spain, has fallen on hard times. The shipbuilding industry, which was a primary source of jobs, has laid off many workers. Several of these erstwhile shipbuilders spend their newfound free time at a local bar owned by their friend Rico (Joaquín Climent). The group is headed by Santa (Javier Bardem), a steadfast pragmatist who tries to keep the spirits of the men high. Troubles are many, however, including the marital problems of Amador (Celso Bugallo) and José (Luis Tosar).;;Drama;;Fernando León de Aranoa;;2002;;Javier Bardem,Luis Tosar,José Ángel Egido,Enrique Villén,Celso Bugallo,Joaquín Climent,Aida Folch,Serge Riaboukine,Laura Dominguez;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mondays_in_the_sun

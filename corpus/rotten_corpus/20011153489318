Together;;89;;90;;R;;Goran runs a Stockholm commune in the 1970s. The easygoing Goran does his best to keep the peace between the politically contentious people around him, many of whom are drunk or stoned on a regular basis. When Goran's sister Elisabeth (Lisa Lindgren) flees from her abusive husband, her arrival at the commune significantly changes its dynamics. Elisabeth's two children bring change, agitating for TV and meat and driving away the commune's purists as tensions spread.;;Drama,Comedy;;Lukas Moodysson;;2001;;Lisa Lindgren,Jessica Liedberg,Ola Rapace,Shanti Roney,Sam Kessel,Emma Samuelsson,Cecilia Frode,Henrik Lundstrom,Therese Brunnander,Claes Hartelius,Olle Sarri,Axel Zuber,Sten Ljunggren;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/together_2001

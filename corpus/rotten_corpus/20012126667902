Baby Boy;;87;;71;;R;;The story of Jody (Tyrese Gibson), a misguided, 20-year-old African-American who is really just a baby boy finally forced-kicking and screaming to face the commitments of real life. Streetwise and jobless, he has not only fathered two children by two different women-Yvette (Taraji P. Henson) and Peanut (Tamara LaSeon Bass) but still lives with his own mother. He can't seem to strike a balance or find direction in his chaotic life.;;Drama;;John Singleton;;2001;;Tyrese Gibson,Omar Gooding,Adrienne-Joi Johnson,Taraji P.

The Yes Men;;67;;85;;R;;This documentary showcases the beginnings of the "Yes Men," a parody group started by Mike Bonanno and Andy Bichlbaum, who initially set up a fake World Trade Organization website to spoof the hypocrisy of the group. Gradually, conferences and news media started to contact the two men thinking they were the actual WTO. Mike and Andy began impersonating members of the WTO at these events, using exaggerated and callous statements to satirize the actions of the organization.;;Documentary;;Dan Ollman,Sarah Price,Chris Smith;;2004;;Andy Bichlbaum,Mike Bonanno,Michael Moore,Laura Nix,Marco Deseriis,Wago Kreider,Patrick Lichty,Matt McElligott;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/yes_men

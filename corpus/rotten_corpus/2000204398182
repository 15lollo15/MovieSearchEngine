Chuck &amp; Buck;;66;;84;;R;;"Chuck & Buck" is the story of a childlike young man who becomes fixated on his onetime best friend, now a cool, polished young record executive. Charting the collision of two individuals, once inseparable, who have responded in opposite ways to the onset of adulthood, the film takes a clear-eyed, sensitive look at childhood and the consequences of hanging onto it too tightly or renouncing it too thoroughly.;;Lgbtq+,Comedy,Drama;;Miguel Arteta;;2000;;Mike White,Chris Weitz,Lupe Ontiveros,Beth Colt,Paul Weitz,Maya Rudolph,Mary Wigmore,Paul Sand,Gino Buccola;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chuck_and_buck

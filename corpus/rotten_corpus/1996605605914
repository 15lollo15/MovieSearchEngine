Get on the Bus;;71;;89;;R;;A disparate group of African-American men climb on a bus bound for the Million Man March in Washington, D.C. -- among them, Evan Sr. (Thomas Jefferson Byrd) and his son, Smooth (De'aundre Bonds), who have been shackled together as a condition of Smooth's temporary probation. Although the group begins the trip as strangers, their shared stories and experiences unite them as their discourse builds a portrait of what it means to be black in America.;;Lgbtq+,Drama;;Spike Lee;;1996;;Richard Belzer,De'aundre Bonds,Andre Braugher,Thomas Jefferson Byrd,Gabriel Casseus,Albert Hall,Hill Harper,Harry Lennix,Bernie Mac,Wendell Pierce,Roger Guenveur Smith,Isaiah Washington,Steve White,Ossie Davis,Charles S.

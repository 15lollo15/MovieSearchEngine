The Unforeseen;;69;;90;;NC;;Real estate developer Tom Bradley has a dream: to build a subdivision. But the realization of that dream in Austin, Texas, has results far beyond his own imagining.

Opposition to the project, in turn, is used by conservatives to muster support for the dismantling of environmental protections and, ultimately, the election of George W. Bush as governor.;;Documentary;;Laura Dunn;;2007;;Robert Redford,Willie Nelson,Ann Richards;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_unforeseen

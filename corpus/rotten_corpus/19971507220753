Lost Highway;;87;;62;;R;;From this inventory of imagery, Lynch fashions two separate but intersecting stories, one about a jazz musician (Bill Pullman), tortured by the notion that his wife is having an affair, who suddenly finds himself accused of her murder. The other is a young mechanic (Balthazar Getty) drawn into a web of deceit by a temptress who is cheating on her gangster boyfriend. These two tales are linked by the fact that the women in both are played by the same actress (Patricia Arquette).;;Drama;;David Lynch;;1997;;Bill Pullman,Patricia Arquette,Balthazar Getty,Robert Blake,Natasha Gregson Wagner,Richard Pryor,Michael Massee,Jack Nance,Jack Kehler,Henry Rollins,Gene Ross,Scott Coffey,Gary Busey,Robert Loggia,John Roselius,Louis Eppolito,Michael Shamus Wiles,Mink Stole,Leonard Termo,Jenna Maetlind;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lost_highway

Tsotsi;;86;;82;;R;;A South African hoodlum named Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae) lives by a code of violence, and he and his gang of thugs prowl the streets of Johannesburg day and night, attacking those who fail to give them what they want. After casually shooting a woman and stealing her car, he discovers her baby in the back seat. Instead of harming the mewling infant, he takes it home and cares for it. The child acts as a catalyst for the hardened thug to regain his humanity.;;Drama;;Gavin Hood;;2006;;Presley Chweneyagae,Mothusi Magano,Israel Makoe,Percy Matsemela,Jerry Mofokeng,Benny Moshe,Nambitha Mpumlwana,Zenzo Ngqobe,Kenneth Nkosi,Terry Pheto;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tsotsi

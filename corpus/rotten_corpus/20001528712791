The Virgin Suicides;;81;;77;;R;;In an ordinary suburban house, on a lovely tree-lined street, in the middle of 1970s America, lived the five beautiful, dreamy Lisbon sisters, whose doomed fates indelibly marked the neighborhood boys who to this day continue to obsess over them. A story of love and repression, fantasy and terror, sex and death, memory and longing. It is at its core a mystery story: a heart-rending investigation into the impenetrable, life-altering secrets of American adolescence.;;Drama;;Sofia Coppola;;2000;;James Woods,Kathleen Turner,Kirsten Dunst,Josh Hartnett,Hanna Hall,Chelse Swain,A.J.

Tarnation;;82;;92;;NC;;Filmmaker Jonathan Caouette examines his family history in this inventive low-budget documentary. Collecting decades' worth of home movies and videotapes, answering machine messages and family snapshots, the film documents both the mental illness of his mother, Renee, and Caouette's own early recognition of his homosexuality. The pair's survival in an atmosphere of pervasive abuse, addiction and abandonment is balanced by Caouette's stable adult relationship with his caring boyfriend.;;Documentary;;Jonathan Caouette;;2003;;NC;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tarnation

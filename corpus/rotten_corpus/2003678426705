American Splendor;;86;;94;;R;;Underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar, portrayed by Paul Giamatti but also appearing as himself, is the subject of this inventive biopic. Much of the film focuses on the eccentric Pekar's day-to-day life in Cleveland, particularly his relationship with his patient wife, Joyce Brabner (played by Hope Davis and also appearing as herself). As Pekar's musings are brought to the screen in this unique and engaging production, the movie playfully incorporates comic book-like panels.;;Biography,Comedy,Drama;;Shari Springer Berman,Robert Pulcini;;2003;;Paul Giamatti,Harvey Pekar,Shari Springer Berman,Earl Billings,James Urbaniak,Judah Friedlander;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/american_splendor

I Am Trying to Break Your Heart;;90;;88;;NC;;This insightful documentary chronicles the tumultuous recording and release of the band Wilco's 2002 album "Yankee Hotel Foxtrot." A bold departure from the group's earlier releases, recording it nearly broke up the band, and when it was completed, their label refused to release it and eventually dumped Wilco from their roster. With the album completed, the band turned to the Internet to get attention for the record, which was eventually released to widespread success and critical acclaim.;;Documentary;;Sam Jones;;2002;;Jeff Tweedy,John Stirratt,Leroy Bach,Glenn Kotche,Jay Bennett;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_am_trying_to_break_your_heart

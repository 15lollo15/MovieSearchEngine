Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos;;80;;81;;PG-13;;This documentary looks back on a time when soccer briefly captured America's attention. The film profiles the North American Soccer League franchise the New York Cosmos and the sensation it created back in the 1970s. Using archival footage, old photos and anecdotes from former players and businessmen, it tells the story -- or several conflicting stories -- of a team starring Brazilian soccer legend Pele, formed by non-sports people and ultimately submarined by the league's excessive expansion.;;Documentary;;Paul Crowder,John Dower;;2006;;Matt Dillon;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10006849-once_in_a_lifetime

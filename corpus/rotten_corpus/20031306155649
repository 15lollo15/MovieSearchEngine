My Architect;;83;;93;;NC;;Director Nathaniel Kahn barely knew his father, but many throughout the world did. He was renowned architect Louis Kahn, who designed noteworthy buildings in California, Texas and even Bangladesh. Nathaniel explores his father's past, interviewing architects such as Frank O.

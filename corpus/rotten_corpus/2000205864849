Dinosaur;;48;;64;;PG;;This is the story of Aladar (D.B. Sweeney), an iguanodon dinosaur raised by a family of lemurs. Their world is turned upside-down however, when meteors strike, turning their green world into a desert wasteland. Teaming up with a herd of other herbivores, the trek is on to find the "Nesting Ground" where water and vegetation is bountiful... but with carnivores behind them and nothing but desert around for miles, it doesn't look promising!;;Adventure,Kids & family;;Eric Leighton,Ralph Zondag;;2000;;D.B.

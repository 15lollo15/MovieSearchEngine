The Five Obstructions;;84;;89;;NC;;In 1967, experimental filmmaker Jorgen Leth created a striking short film, "The Perfect Human," starring a man and women sitting in a box while a narrator poses questions about their relationship and humanity. Years later, Danish director Lars von Trier made a deal with Leth to remake the film five times, each under a different set of circumstances and with von Trier's strictly prescribed rules. As Leth completes each challenge, von Trier creates ever more elaborate rules for the contest.;;Documentary;;JÃ¸rgen Leth,Lars von Trier;;2003;;Claus Nissen;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/five_obstructions

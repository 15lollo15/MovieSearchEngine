Tropical Malady;;77;;78;;NC;;Keng (Banlop Lomnoi) is a soldier stationed in a quiet Thai village where the days progress with methodical slowness. Not much happens of interest until Keng encounters local boy Tong (Sakda Kaewbuadee), and the pair begin a tentative romance. Then, in a surreal move typical of director Apichatpong Weerasethakul, the film splinters into a story about a soldier (also Lomnoi) searching for a lost boy in the jungle and meeting a vexing spirit (also Kaewbuadee).;;Romance,Drama;;Apichatpong Weerasethakul;;2004;;Banlop Lomnoi,Sakda Kaewbuadee,Huai Dessom,Sirivech Jareonchon,Udom Promma;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tropical_malady

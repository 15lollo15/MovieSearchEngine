Waiting for Superman;;84;;90;;PG;;This film by director Davis Guggenheim investigates the public school system in the United States, and uncovers the many ways in which education in America has declined. Rather than relying largely on statistics and expert opinions, Guggenheim focuses on five students -- Anthony, Bianca, Daisy, Emily and Francisco -- portraying their own individual struggles and triumphs within problem-plagued academic settings where there are no easy solutions to the myriad issues that affect them.;;Documentary;;Davis Guggenheim;;2010;;Charles Adam,Jonathan Alter,Robert Balfanz,Harriet Ball,Steve Barr,Ms. Celeste Bell;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waiting_for_superman

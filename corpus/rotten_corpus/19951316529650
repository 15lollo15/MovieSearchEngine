Seeing herself as a matchmaker, Cher first coaxes two teachers into dating each other. Emboldened by her success, she decides to give hopelessly klutzy new student Tai (Brittany Murphy) a makeover. When Tai becomes more popular than she is, Cher realizes that her disapproving ex-stepbrother (Paul Rudd) was right about how misguided she was -- and falls for him.;;Comedy;;Amy Heckerling;;1995;;Alicia Silverstone,Stacey Dash,Brittany Murphy,Paul Rudd,Dan Hedaya,Donald Faison,Elisa Donovan,Breckin Meyer,Jeremy Sisto,Aida Linares,Wallace Shawn,Twink Caplan;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/clueless

Up and Down;;74;;83;;R;;Post-Soviet Prague is seen through parallel stories of Czechs who share the same city, and yet are worlds apart. Human traffickers ditch a foreign baby with a working-class couple, who so love their new child that the husband (Jirí Machácek) drops his racist soccer hooligan pals. Meanwhile, middle-class Martin (Petr Forman) returns home years after his now-ailing father wooed and won his girlfriend from him. Since then, the couple has raised a child, Martin's sister -- or maybe his daughter.;;Drama,Comedy;;Jan Hrebejk;;2004;;Petr Forman,Emilia Vásáryová,Natasa Burger,Jan Tríska,Ingrid Timková,Kristýna Boková,Pavel Liska,Marek Daniel,Jan Budar,Zdenek Suchý,Jaroslav Dusek,Václav Havel,Jirí Machácek;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/up_and_down

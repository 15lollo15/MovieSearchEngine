Eureka;;91;;91;;NC;;This 3 hour and 40 minute, beautifully composed black and white film explores a transcendent story of redemption. On what seemed to be a normal morning in southwest Japan, a crazed killer, apparently without motive, hijacks a city bus. The killings seem to follow the only three survivors until each finds some way to come to terms with the horror they once shared.;;Drama;;Shinji Aoyama;;2001;;Kôji Yakusho,Aoi Miyazaki,Masaru Miyazaki,Yoichiro Saito,Ken Mitsuishi,Gô Rijû,Yutaka Matsushige,Sansei Shiomi,Kimie Shingyoji;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eureka_2001

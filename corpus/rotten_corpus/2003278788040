Step Into Liquid;;93;;81;;PG;;In a documentary shot in waters all over the globe, director Dana Brown takes on tall waves and surfers who live to challenge them. The film treks from the Irish coast, where a trio of American brothers take on the Atlantic surf, to Rapa Nui in the Pacific, where the Easter Island statues gaze out at board-riding daredevils. Brown also finds good surfing in unlikely places, like Wisconsin and Texas, and charts the rise of female surfers in a sport traditionally dominated by males.;;Documentary;;Dana Brown;;2003;;Dana Brown;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/step_into_liquid

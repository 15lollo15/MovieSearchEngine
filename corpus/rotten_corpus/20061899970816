Man Push Cart;;66;;89;;NC;;Ahmad (Ahmad Razvi) is a Pakistani-born cart vendor who sells bagels and coffee in Manhattan, a humble and bleak means of a living that affords him little comfort. In his former life in Pakistan, he was a rock star. He was also married and had a child. Now his wife is dead, his in-laws refuse him visits with his son, and his job is all he seems to have, but he seems content with his fate. However, a chance encounter with a businessman may change Ahmad's fortune -- for better, or worse.;;Drama;;Ramin Bahrani;;2006;;Ahmad Razvi,Leticia Dolera,Charles Daniel Sandoval,Ali Reza,Farooq "Duke" Muhammad,Panicker Upendran;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/man_push_cart

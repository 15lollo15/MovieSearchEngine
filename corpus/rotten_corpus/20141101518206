The Drop;;76;;89;;R;;Bob Saginowski (Tom Hardy) tends bar in his cousin's pub and looks the other way when local mobsters use the joint as a temporary bank. His simple life takes a complicated turn when he finds a battered puppy. He asks his neighbor, Nadia (Noomi Rapace), for help nursing it back to health, and a mutual attraction sparks between them. However, a robbery at the bar and the return of Nadia's abusive ex force Bob to face the truth about those he thinks he knows best -- including himself.;;Drama,Crime;;MichaÃ«l R.

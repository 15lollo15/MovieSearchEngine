Why Do Fools Fall in Love;;76;;52;;R;;In 1956, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers landed a doo-wop hit with "Why Do Fools Fall in Love?" Fame turned to tragedy as lead singer Lymon (Larenz Tate) descended into substance abuse that eventually claimed his life at age 25. But Lymon didn't just leave his fans bereft -- he also left behind three women, and each believes she's owed his song royalties: Platters singer Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), prostitute Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox) and schoolteacher Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon).;;Biography;;Gregory Nava;;1998;;Halle Berry,Vivica A.

The Magdalene Sisters;;89;;91;;R;;In 1964, three teenage Irish girls are sent to a Magdalene asylum, an archaic home for "fallen women," though their crimes aren't criminal. Rose (Dorothy Duffy) is pregnant out of wedlock, Bernadette (Nora-Jane Noone) has been caught flirting with a boy at school, and Margaret (Anne-Marie Duff) is sentenced for having been raped by a family member. There, the girls perform hard labor supervised by cruel nuns, led by the sneering Sister Bridget (Geraldine McEwan) -- and dream of escape.;;Drama;;Peter Mullan;;2002;;Geraldine McEwan,Anne-Marie Duff,Nora Jane Noone,Dorothy Duffy,Eileen Walsh,Mary Murray,Britta Smith,Frances Healy,Eithne McGuinness,Rebecca Walsh,Eamonn Owens,Chris Simpson,Sean Colgan,Daniel Costello;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/magdalene_sisters

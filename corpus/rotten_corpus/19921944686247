The Muppet Christmas Carol;;86;;75;;G;;The Muppets perform the classic Dickens holiday tale, with Kermit the Frog playing Bob Cratchit, the put-upon clerk of stingy Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine). Other Muppets -- Miss Piggy, Gonzo, Fozzie Bear and Sam the Eagle -- weave in and out of the story, while Scrooge receives visits from spirits of three Christmases -- past, present and future. They show him the error of his self-serving ways, but the miserable old man seems to be past any hope of redemption and happiness.;;Fantasy,Other,Kids & family;;Brian Henson;;1992;;Michael Caine,Dave Goelz,Steve Whitmire,Jerry Nelson,David Rudman,Frank Oz,Jessica Fox,Steven Mackintosh;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/muppet_christmas_carol

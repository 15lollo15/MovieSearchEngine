No Man's Land;;92;;93;;R;;Ciki (Branko Djuric) and Nino (Rene Bitorajac), a Bosnian and a Serb, are soldiers stranded in No Man's Land -- a trench between enemy lines during the Bosnian war. They have no one to trust, no way to escape without getting shot, and a fellow soldier is lying on the trench floor with a spring-loaded bomb set to explode beneath him if he moves. The absurdity of their situation would be comical if it didn't have such dire consequences.;;War,Comedy;;Danis Tanovic;;2001;;Branko Djuric,Rene Bitorajac,Filip Sovagovic,Georges Siatidis,Katrin Cartlidge,Simon Callow,Serge-Henri Valcke;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/no_mans_land

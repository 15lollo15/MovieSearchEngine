What About Bob?;;79;;84;;PG;;Before going on vacation, self-involved psychiatrist Dr. Leo Marvin (Richard Dreyfuss) has the misfortune of taking on a new patient: Bob Wiley (Bill Murray). An exemplar of neediness and a compendium of phobias, Bob follows Marvin to his family's country house. Dr. Marvin tries to get him to leave; the trouble is, everyone love Bob. As his oblivious patient makes himself at home, Dr. Marvin loses his professional composure and, before long, may be ready for the loony bin himself.;;Comedy;;Frank Oz;;1991;;Bill Murray,Richard Dreyfuss,Julie Hagerty,Charlie Korsmo,Kathryn Erbe,Tom Aldredge,Susan Willis,Roger Bowen,Fran Brill;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/what_about_bob

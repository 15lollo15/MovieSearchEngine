In desperation, Billy kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci) from a tap dancing class and pleads with her to impersonate his wife and to accompany him home to visit his parents, Janet (Anjelica Huston) and Jimmy (Ben Gazzara). To Billy's dismay, Layla takes to her role enthusiastically. She breaks through to obsessive Buffalo Bills football fan Janet and the hard-edged Jimmy.;;Drama;;Vincent Gallo;;1998;;Vincent Gallo,Christina Ricci,Anjelica Huston,Ben Gazzara,Kevin Corrigan,Mickey Rourke,Rosanna Arquette,Jan-Michael Vincent;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/buffalo_66

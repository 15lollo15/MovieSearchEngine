Meanwhile, their guide, Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood), refuses to acknowledge that they may be several weeks off-course. When a Native American (Rod Rondeaux) is captured, Emily Tetherow (Michelle Williams), one of the settlers, shields him from Meek's wrath, and he offers to lead the group to water in return.;;Western;;Kelly Reichardt;;2010;;Michelle Williams,Bruce Greenwood,Will Patton,Zoe Kazan,Paul Dano,Shirley Henderson,Neal Huff,Tommy Nelson,Rod Rondeaux;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/meeks_cutoff

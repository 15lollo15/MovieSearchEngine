Trophy Wife;;61;;83;;R;;In 1977 France, tightfisted factory owner Robert Pujol (Fabrice Luchini) is so shocked when his workers strike for higher wages that he suffers a heart attack. His acquiescent wife, Suzanne (Catherine Deneuve), whose father had founded the factory, takes over management duties during Robert's convalescence. To her own surprise, Suzanne turns out to be a natural leader whose less dictatorial management inspires both her workers and local liberal politician Babin (Gérard Depardieu).;;Comedy;;François Ozon;;2010;;Catherine Deneuve,Gérard Depardieu,Fabrice Luchini,Karine Viard,Judith Godrèche,Jérémie Renier,Sergi López,Évelyne Dandry,Bruno Lochet;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/potiche

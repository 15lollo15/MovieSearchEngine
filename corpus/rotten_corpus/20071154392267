2 Days in Paris;;71;;88;;R;;A European vacation was intended to repair the tattered relationship between American Jack (Adam Goldberg) and French native Marion (Julie Delpy). But, by the time they arrive in Paris to visit Marion's family, it is clear the trip is not going well. The city brings out aspects of Marion that only alienate neurotic Jack further, from her in-your-face politics to her former boyfriends, who surface in every cafe. Thus the most romantic city in the world could mean the end of the couple's romance.;;Comedy,Romance;;Julie Delpy;;2007;;Julie Delpy,Adam Goldberg,Daniel Br√ºhl,Albert Delpy,Alexia Landeau,Marie Pillet,Adan Jodorowsky;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/2_days_in_paris

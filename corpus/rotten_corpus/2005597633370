Murderball;;89;;98;;R;;This documentary introduces the U.S. quad rugby team -- a team composed entirely of young paraplegic men. Using special wheelchairs and very little protection, the players play full-contact competitive rugby, using rules only slightly altered to accommodate their limitations. The film follows the team as they discuss the sport, their lives, and how they ended up in their chairs to begin with, while they play their way to the 2004 Paralympic Games in Athens, Greece.;;Documentary;;Henry Alex Rubin,Dana Adam Shapiro;;2005;;NC;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/murderball

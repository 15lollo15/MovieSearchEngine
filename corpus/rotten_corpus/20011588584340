Secret Ballot;;63;;82;;G;;A ballot box is parachuted down as a young woman pulls up to the shore of a remote island. To a soldier's surprise, she's actually the government bureaucrat in charge of local voting. Whether he wants to or not, the soldier is thrown into an elections adventure that just may put him out of a job. Orders from above force him to accompany the female agent in an Army jeep across the island's dusty desert. The agent literally leaves no stone unturned in her search for ballots.;;Comedy;;Babak Payami;;2001;;Nassim Abdi,Cyrus Abidi,Youssef Habashi,Farrokh Shojaii,Gholbahar Janghali;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/secret_ballot

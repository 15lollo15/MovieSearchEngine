Raising Victor Vargas;;83;;96;;R;;On New York City's Lower East Side, Dominican teen and aspiring ladies' man Victor Vargas (Victor Rasuk) has nothing but girls on his mind. Though he talks a big game at the local pool, Vargas' true experience amounts to nothing more than a string of romantic rejections. After Vargas fails to improve his abysmal reputation by bedding an overweight classmate, he chooses a much more difficult target -- the stunning and stuck-up Judy Ramirez (Judy Marte).;;Comedy,Drama;;Peter Sollett;;2002;;Victor Rasuk,Judy Marte,Melonie Diaz,Altagracia Guzman,Silvestre Rasuk,Krystal Rodriguez,Kevin Rivera,Wilfree Vasquez,Donna Maldonado;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/raising_victor_vargas

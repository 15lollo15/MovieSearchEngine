GasLand;;85;;98;;NC;;When Josh Fox receives a $100,000 offer from a natural gas company interested in exploring in his land in Pennsylvania's Delaware River Basin, he decides to do his own research on drilling and the process known as fracking. Josh sets out to interview those who live near drilling sites, and his findings are frightening -- their wells contaminated, residents can actually set their tap water on fire. Visits to sites in Colorado, Wyoming and Texas yield similar horrific findings.;;Documentary;;Josh Fox;;2010;;Josh Fox,Aubrey K.

The Death of Mr. Lazarescu;;82;;94;;R;;Mr. Lazarescu (Ion Fiscuteanu) is a retired Romanian engineer, spending his time in the company of his cats and booze. When he starts feeling unusually ill, he first seeks painkillers from his neighbors. It soon becomes apparent that Lazarescu is indeed sick, and an ambulance arrives with a nurse (Luminita Gheorghiu) who has a few ideas about what could be the problem. However, a major traffic accident and poor organization leaves little room in Romanian hospitals for the fading Lazarescu.;;Drama;;Cristi Puiu;;2005;;Ion Fiscuteanu,Luminita Gheorghiu,Gabriel Spahiu,Doru Ana,Dana Dogaru,Serban Pavlu,Florin Zamfirescu,Clara Voda,Adrian Titieni,Mihai Bratila,Mimi Branescu,Rodica Lazar,Alina Berzunteanu,Mirela Cioaba;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_death_of_mr_lazarescu

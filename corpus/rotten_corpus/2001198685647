The Swamp;;79;;88;;NC;;This Argentinean tale, which revolves around a group of families passing summer vacation in a rural country house, does not rely on a concrete plot line, but rather roves, rambles, and stumbles upon each new event. No event, no action, no exchange of words, no scene of the movie is more or less important than another. Instead, the film continues nonsequentially in what feels like a prolonged wait.;;Drama;;Lucrecia Martel;;2001;;Mercedes Morán,Graciela Borges,Martin Adjemian,Diego Baenas,Leonora Balcarce,Silvia Baylé,Juan Cruz Bordeu,Noelia Bravo Herrera,Andrea Lopez,Sebastian Montagna,Daniel Valenzuela,Franco Veneranda,Fabio Villafane;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/la_cienaga

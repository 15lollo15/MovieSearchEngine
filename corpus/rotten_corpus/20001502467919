Little Otik;;85;;84;;NC;;The equation has never been more accurate than in the brilliant Czech surrealist's newest film, "Little Otik," based upon a classic fairy tale of an infertile couple who adopt a tree stump as their baby. It quickly grows into an all-devouring monster that eats the cat and then the postman. Locked in the basement, Otik becomes a favorite of Alzbetka, a creepily precocious little girl, who is otherwise engaged in reading books on sexual dysfunction and warding off an octogenarian pedophile.;;Fantasy,Comedy,Drama;;Jan Svankmajer;;2000;;Veronika Zilkov√°,Jan Hartl,Kristina Adamcova,Jaroslava Kretschmerova,Pavel Novy;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/little_otik

A Mighty Wind;;75;;88;;PG-13;;In this hilarious backstage mockumentary, three eclectic, never-quite-famous folk bands come together for the first time in decades following the death of their manager to put on an reunion concert in his honor, at the request of his son (Bob Balaban). For the members of The Folksmen, The New Main Street Singers, and Mitch & Mickey, time has not been kind. As the show approaches, apprehension sets in, romances are rekindled and ambitions are permanently deferred.;;Comedy;;Christopher Guest;;2003;;Bob Balaban,Christopher Guest,John Michael Higgins,Eugene Levy,Jane Lynch,Michael McKean,Catherine O'Hara,Parker Posey,Harry Shearer,Fred Willard,Floyd Vanbuskirk;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mighty_wind

Jesus' Son;;83;;80;;R;;Set in the early 1970's, "Jesus' Son" is a series of linked yet discrete stories that chart the to-hell-and-back journey of a young man known only as "FH." Told in the way a person might recount a series of anecdotes over a drink -- with all the mistakes and exaggerations, false starts and shuttling back in time that inevitably occurs -- it is a stunning glimpse into the way one man's heart and mind work.;;Drama;;Alison Maclean;;1999;;Billy Crudup,Samantha Morton,Denis Leary,Jack Black,Will Patton,Greg Germann,Holly Hunter,Dennis Hopper;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/jesus_son

No Impact Man;;63;;83;;NC;;This documentary tells the story of author Colin Beavan, who went completely "green," giving up virtually all of the comforts of modern living -- electricity, gas-powered transportation, shipped food and public waste disposal -- in a drastic effort to curb his environmental impact. The cameras capture the toll this well-intentioned, year-long project takes on Beavan's wife and baby daughter, as well as the ways it brings this family closer together.;;Documentary;;Laura Gabbert,Justin Schein;;2009;;Colin Beavan;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1213732-no_impact_man

Baghead;;49;;79;;R;;Spurred on by a colleague's success, four struggling filmmakers (Steve Zissis, Ross Partridge, Greta Gerwig, Elise Muller) endeavor to jump-start their careers. Together, they retreat to a cabin in the haunting back woods of Big Bear, California, where they hatch an idea for a new film -- a horror flick about a guy with a bag on his head who torments people. But when romantic interests crisscross and their story comes to life, they find finishing the script may be the least of their concerns.;;Mystery & thriller,Comedy;;Jay Duplass,Mark Duplass;;2008;;Ross Partridge,Steve Zissis,Greta Gerwig,Elise Muller,Jett Garner;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/baghead

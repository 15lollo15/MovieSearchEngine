Profane political spin doctor Malcolm Tucker (Peter Capaldi) tries to cover up Foster's faux pas, but the ill-conceived comment is picked up by a warmongering American official. Foster is invited to Washington, D.C., where a war of words brews as politicians maneuver, manipulate and deceive each other before a U.N. vote on military action.;;Comedy;;Armando Iannucci;;2009;;Peter Capaldi,Tom Hollander,Gina McKee,James Gandolfini,Chris Addison,Anna Chlumsky,Paul Higgins,Mimi Kennedy,Steve Coogan,Enzo Cilenti,Christian Contreras,Olivia Poulet,David Rasche,Joanna Scanlan;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/in_the_loop

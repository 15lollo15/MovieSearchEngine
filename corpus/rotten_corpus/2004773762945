Shaun of the Dead;;93;;92;;R;;Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a 30-something loser with a dull, easy existence. When he's not working at the electronics store, he lives with his slovenly best friend, Ed (Nick Frost), in a small flat on the outskirts of London. The only unpredictable element in his life is his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), who wishes desperately for Shaun to grow up and be a man. When the town is inexplicably overrun with zombies, Shaun must rise to the occasion and protect both Liz and his mother (Penelope Wilton).;;Horror,Comedy;;Edgar Wright;;2004;;Simon Pegg,Kate Ashfield,Lucy Davis,Nick Frost,Dylan Moran,Bill Nighy,Penelope Wilton,Jessica Hynes,Peter Serafinowicz,Mark Donovan,Krishnan Guru-Murthy,Rafe Spall,Jeremy Thompson;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shaun_of_the_dead

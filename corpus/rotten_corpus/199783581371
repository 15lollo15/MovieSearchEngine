Wilde;;73;;72;;R;;Oscar Wilde (Stephen Fry) is a married writer who has occasionally indulged his weakness for male suitors. After much toil, Wilde debuts a stage comedy in London, and a chat at the theater with Lord Alfred "Bosie" Douglas (Jude Law) leads to a full-on romance. Wilde ends up in a legal dispute with Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson) and, given the anti-gay local laws, is sent to jail. Wilde's vast intellect helps him survive until he regains his freedom.;;Biography,Lgbtq+;;Brian Gilbert;;1997;;Stephen Fry,Jude Law,Vanessa Redgrave,Jennifer Ehle,Gemma Jones,Judy Parfitt,Michael Sheen,ZoÃ« Wanamaker,Tom Wilkinson;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/wilde

The White Ribbon;;79;;86;;R;;Using their social status and harsh punishments, a baron (Ulrich Tukur), a doctor (Rainer Bock) and a pastor (Burghart Klaussner) rule over a small German village. One day, the doctor falls off his horse after it trips over a wire strung between two trees. More pranks follow, seemingly without reason, all directed at the village's upper class and growing increasingly more brutal with time. There are no suspects, but a local schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) has his suspicions.;;Drama,War;;Michael Haneke;;2009;;Christian Friedel,Leonie Benesch,Ulrich Tukur,Ursina Lardi,Burghart Klaußner,Steffi Kühnert,Josef Bierbichler,Gabriela Maria Schmeide,Rainer Bock,Susanne Lothar,Maria-Victoria Dragus,Leonard Proxauf,Janina Fautz,Eddy Grahl,Ernst Jacobi;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/white_ribbon

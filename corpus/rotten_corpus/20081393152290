Beaufort;;72;;85;;NC;;Near the end of the war in Lebanon, a group of Israeli soldiers defends an isolated mountain outpost next to a 12th-century fortress called Beaufort Castle. Moving through a maze-like underground structure, they are under constant bombardment and stress. The young commander, Liraz (Oshri Cohen), is at odds with demolitions expert, Ziv (Ohad Knoller), and things become even more tense as the troops prepare to withdraw and possibly destroy the very bunker they've been defending.;;Drama,Action,War;;Joseph Cedar;;2008;;Alon Aboutboul,Eli Altonio,Daniel Brook,Oshri Cohen,Gal Friedman,Ohad Knoller;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/beaufort

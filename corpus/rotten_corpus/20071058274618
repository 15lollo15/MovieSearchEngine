Gypsy Caravan;;82;;86;;NC;;Combining footage from 1999 and 2001 tours, this documentary follows five different gypsy bands as they perform across America. Their music is as diverse as their home countries, from Indian raga tunes to upbeat, fiddle-driven Romanian pieces. Despite their varied backgrounds, the musicians are united by their common identification with the "roma" gypsy culture. As the tour progresses, the musicians begin playing together, fusing their styles into new hybrids.;;Documentary;;Jasmine Dellal;;2007;;NC;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/gypsy_caravan_when_the_road_bends

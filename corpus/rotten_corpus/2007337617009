Taxi to the Dark Side;;90;;100;;R;;This documentary explores the American military's use of torture by focusing on the unsolved murder of an Afhgani taxi driver who, in 2002, was taken for questioning at Bagram Force Air Base. Five days later, the man was dead. The medical examiner claimed the driver died from excessive physical abuse. Taking this case as a jumping-off point, the film examines wider claims of torture that occurred at bases like Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay during the Bush administration.;;War,Documentary,Crime,Drama;;Alex Gibney;;2007;;Alex Gibney,Brian Keith Allen,Jack Cloonan,Greg D'Agostino,Carl Levin,Moazzam Begg;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/taxi_to_the_dark_side

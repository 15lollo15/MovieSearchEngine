Cronos;;69;;89;;R;;Antique dealer Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) stumbles across Cronos, a 400-year-old scarab that, when it latches onto him, grants him youth and eternal life -- but also a thirst for blood. As Jesus enjoys his newfound vitality, he's unaware that a dying old man, Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook), has sent his nephew, Angel (Ron Perlman), to find the scarab and bring it back to him. But Jesus will not give immortality up easily, even risking the life of his orphan granddaughter (Tamara Shanath).;;Horror;;Guillermo del Toro;;1994;;Federico Luppi,Ron Perlman,Claudio Brook,Margarita Isabel,Tamara Shanath,Daniel Giménez Cacho,Mario Iván Martínez;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cronos

Born to Be Wild;;84;;98;;G;;Morgan Freeman narrates this documentary about two dedicated animal preservationists. Daphne Sheldrick has created an elephant sanctuary in Kenya, while Dr. Birut√© Mary Galdikas has set up an orphanage for orangutans in Borneo. In both cases, the young animals have been left alone after their parents were killed, by either poachers or similar human incursions into their natural habitats. Viewers get to see the animals nurtured with love and care before they are introduced back into the wild.;;Documentary;;David Lickley;;2011;;Morgan Freeman;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/born_to_be_wild_2011

Within days, she opens an unusual chocolate shop, across the square from the church. Her ability to perceive her customers' desires and satisfy them with just the right confection, coaxes the villagers to abandon themselves to temptation -- just as Lent begins.;;Drama;;Lasse Hallstr√∂m;;2000;;Juliette Binoche,Johnny Depp,Lena Olin,Judi Dench,Alfred Molina,Peter Stormare,Carrie-Anne Moss,Leslie Caron,John Wood,Hugh O'Conor,Victoire Thivisol,Aurelien Parent Koenig;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chocolat

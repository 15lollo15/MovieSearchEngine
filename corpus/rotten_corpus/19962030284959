Happy Gilmore;;85;;61;;PG-13;;All Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) has ever wanted is to be a professional hockey player. But he soon discovers he may actually have a talent for playing an entirely different sport: golf. When his grandmother (Frances Bay) learns she is about to lose her home, Happy joins a golf tournament to try and win enough money to buy it for her. With his powerful driving skills and foulmouthed attitude, Happy becomes an unlikely golf hero -- much to the chagrin of the well-mannered golf professionals.;;Comedy;;Dennis Dugan;;1996;;Adam Sandler,Christopher McDonald,Julie Bowen,Frances Bay,Carl Weathers,Allen Covert,Robert Smigel,Bob Barker,Richard Kiel,Dennis Dugan,Joe Flaherty,Kevin Nealon;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/happy_gilmore

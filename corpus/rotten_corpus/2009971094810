Sweetgrass;;65;;97;;NC;;This spare documentary follows a group of shepherds as they guide hundreds of sheep through endless miles of Montana wilderness. Herding the livestock through the Beartooth Mountains, the crew covers stunning landscapes as they brave dangerous weather and the threat of various wild animals, including bears and wolves. As the shepherds make their journey, the film depicts the hardships that they face in their age-old occupation, which seems largely outmoded in 21st-century United States.;;Documentary;;Lucien Castaing-Taylor,Illisa Barbash;;2009;;NC;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweetgrass

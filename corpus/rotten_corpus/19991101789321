The Muse;;34;;53;;PG-13;;Screenwriter Steven Phillips (Albert Brooks) seemingly has it all, including an Academy Award for his latest script. But he's hit an artistic dry patch, so his writer friend Jack Warrick (Jeff Bridges) recommends the services of Sarah Little (Sharon Stone), a woman he swears is a veritable muse. Steven takes her on and is suddenly more inspired to create. Her services, however, come at a very steep price and Steven becomes suspicious about who Sarah really is and what she wants.;;Comedy;;Albert Brooks;;1999;;Albert Brooks,Sharon Stone,Andie MacDowell,Jeff Bridges,Mark Feuerstein,Steven Wright,Bradley Whitford,Mario Opinato,Dakin Matthews,Concetta Tomei,Cybill Shepherd,Lorenzo Lamas,Jennifer Tilly,Rob Reiner,Wolfgang Puck,James Cameron,Martin Scorsese,Jamie Alexis,Skip O'Brien,Bobby Edner;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/muse

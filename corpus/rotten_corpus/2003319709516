Sweet Sixteen;;88;;97;;R;;While Liam (Martin Compston) waits for his mother to be released from prison, he aggressively resists the demands of his stepfather and grandfather that he use his mother as a drug mule. Liam dreams of a better life for her, and decides that when she gets out of jail he will take her far away from their family and their former life. However, this plan requires money, so Liam gets it the only way he knows how -- by stealing his stepfather's drugs and selling them on the street.;;Drama;;Ken Loach;;2003;;Martin Compston,William Ruane,Annmarie Fulton,Michelle Abercromby,Michelle Coulter,Gary McCormack,Tommy McKee;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/sweet_sixteen

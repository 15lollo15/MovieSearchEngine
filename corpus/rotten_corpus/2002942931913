The Best of Youth;;98;;94;;R;;Two close-knit brothers, Nicola (Luigi Lo Cascio) and Matteo (Alessio Boni), are buffeted by the social and political upheavals that rock their native Italy during the 1960s and '70s as they navigate their way into adulthood, marriage and middle age. Along the way, Nicola meets Giulia (Sonia Bergamasco), the love of his life whose political beliefs take precedence over her personal happiness, while Matteo falls for the lovely photographer-turned-librarian Mirella (Maya Sansa).;;Drama;;Marco Tullio Giordana;;2002;;Luigi Lo Cascio,Alessio Boni,Adriana Asti,Sonia Bergamasco,Fabrizio Gifuni,Maya Sansa,Valentina Carnelutti,Jasmine Trinca,Andrea Tidona,Lidia Vitale,Camilla Filippi,Greta Cavuoti,Sara Pavoncello,Claudio Gio√®;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/best_of_youth

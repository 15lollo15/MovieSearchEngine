My Winnipeg;;77;;95;;NC;;Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin conducts a personal tour of Winnipeg, Manitoba, the town where he grew up and still lives, in a film he calls a "docu-fantasia." By combining archival footage and interviews, dreamlike camera work and recreated scenes -- including several with actress Ann Savage playing the part of Maddin's mother -- the filmmaker builds a portrait of Winnipeg that manages to be historical, intimate, surreal, entertaining and entirely his own.;;Documentary,Comedy,Drama;;Guy Maddin;;2007;;Guy Maddin,Ann Savage,Louis Negin,Amy Stewart,Darcy Fehr,Kate Yacula;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1195800-my_winnipeg

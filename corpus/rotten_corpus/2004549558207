Goodbye, Dragon Inn;;73;;80;;NC;;In Taipei, a movie theater is closing, but not before one final film is shown -- "Dragon Inn," a 1967 actioner and the source of nostalgia for the moviegoers and employees in the old, decrepit and possibly haunted building. The workers include eccentric projectionist Hsiao-Kang (Lee Kang-sheng) and a crippled cashier (Shiang-chyi Chen). The patrons include a Japanese tourist (Kiyonobu Mitamura) and two ghostly actors from the original film who have come to mourn the passing of an era.;;Drama;;Ming-liang Tsai;;2004;;Lee Kang-sheng,Shiang-chyi Chen,Kiyonobu Mitamura,Miao Tien,Lee Yi-cheng;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/goodbye_dragon_inn_2004

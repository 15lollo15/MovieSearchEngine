Finding Nemo;;86;;99;;G;;Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish, is overly cautious with his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has a foreshortened fin. When Nemo swims too close to the surface to prove himself, he is caught by a diver, and horrified Marlin must set out to find him. A blue reef fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) -- who has a really short memory -- joins Marlin and complicates the encounters with sharks, jellyfish, and a host of ocean dangers. Meanwhile, Nemo plots his escape from a dentist's fish tank.;;Animation,Adventure,Kids & family,Comedy;;Andrew Stanton;;2003;;Albert Brooks,Ellen DeGeneres,Alexander Gould,Willem Dafoe,Brad Garrett,Allison Janney,Austin Pendleton,Stephen Root,Vicki Lewis,Joe Ranft,Geoffrey Rush,Andrew Stanton,Elizabeth Perkins,Nicholas Bird,Bob Peterson,Barry Humphries,Eric Bana,Bruce Spence,Bill Hunter,LuLu Ebeling;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/finding_nemo

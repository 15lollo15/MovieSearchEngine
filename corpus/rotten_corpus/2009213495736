Bright Star;;68;;83;;PG;;In 1818, high-spirited young Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) finds herself increasingly intrigued by the handsome but aloof poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw), who lives next door to her family friends the Dilkes. After reading a book of his poetry, she finds herself even more drawn to the taciturn Keats. Although he agrees to teach her about poetry, Keats cannot act on his reciprocated feelings for Fanny, since as a struggling poet he has no money to support a wife.;;Drama,Romance;;Jane Campion;;2009;;Abbie Cornish,Ben Whishaw,Paul Schneider,Kerry Fox,Edie Martin,Thomas Brodie-Sangster,Claudie Blakley,Gerard Monaco,Antonia Campbell-Hughes;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/bright_star

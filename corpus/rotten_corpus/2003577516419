Sleazy casino boss Victor (John Hurt) encourages Dan to amass more and more debt, until the missing money becomes hard to hide, and Dan's life spirals out of control.;;Drama;;Richard Kwietniowski;;2003;;Philip Seymour Hoffman,Minnie Driver,Maury Chaykin,John Hurt,Sonja Smits,Ian Tracey,Roger Dunn,Jason Blicker,K.C.

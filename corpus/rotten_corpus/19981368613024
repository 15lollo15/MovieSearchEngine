Elizabeth;;86;;83;;R;;Elizabeth Tudor (Cate Blanchett) becomes queen of a divided and dangerous England in 1558. She is roundly perceived as weak by threats from within and abroad, and she is strongly advised to marry by counsel William Cecil (Richard Attenborough). But she will be married only to her country. Intelligent and cautious, she must choose where to place her trust: with her shrewd secretary Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush), a master of espionage, or her secret lover, Sir Robert Dudley (Joseph Fiennes).;;History,Drama;;Shekhar Kapur;;1998;;Cate Blanchett,Geoffrey Rush,Christopher Eccleston,Joseph Fiennes,Richard Attenborough,Fanny Ardant,Kathy Burke,Ã‰ric Cantona,James Frain,Vincent Cassel,Daniel Craig,John Gielgud,Angus Deayton,Edward Hardwicke,Terence Rigby,Amanda Ryan,Kelly Macdonald,Emily Mortimer;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1084153-elizabeth

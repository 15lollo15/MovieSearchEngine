The Story of the Weeping Camel;;87;;94;;PG;;In Mongolia's Gobi desert, a camel belonging to a group of nomadic shepherds gives birth to a white calf. It's a rare occurrence, and the shepherds watch as the unusually-colored offspring is rejected by its mother. Without its mother's milk, the calf will die. To save its life, the nomads send two boys (Enkhbulgan Ikhbayar, Uuganbaatar Ikhbayar) on a journey across the desert to find a musician in the village whose song may compel the camel to accept its calf.;;Documentary;;Byambasuren Davaa,Luigi Falorni;;2004;;Ikhbayar Amgaabazar,Zeveljamz Nyam,Amgaabazar Gonson,Chimed Ohin,Janchiv Ayurzana,Enkhbulgan Ikhbayar,Uuganbaatar Ikhbayar;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_story_of_the_weeping_camel

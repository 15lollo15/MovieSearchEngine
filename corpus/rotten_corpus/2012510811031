In reality, Miller is in over his head, trying desperately to sell his empire to a big bank before the authorities and his family uncover the depth of his fraud. Unexpectedly, a critical error forces Miller to juggle family, business and crime with the aid of a former associate, but a detective's (Tim Roth) suspicions mean it may already be too late.;;Mystery & thriller,Drama;;Nicholas Jarecki;;2012;;Richard Gere,Tim Roth,Susan Sarandon,Brit Marling,Evelina Turen,Monica Raymund,Laetitia Casta,Nate Parker;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/arbitrage

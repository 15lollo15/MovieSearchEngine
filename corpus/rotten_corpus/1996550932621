John Carpenter's Escape From L.A.;;39;;53;;R;;In 2013, the United States president (Cliff Robertson) is exiling all citizens who don't conform to his hyper-conservative views to Los Angeles, which became an island after a huge earthquake. But, when the president's daughter nabs the detonator to her dad's apocalyptic weapon and sneaks into L.A. to be with the rebel leader she loves, the government taps commando-turned-crook Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) to retrieve the young woman. And, if he doesn't succeed quickly, he'll be executed.;;Sci-fi,Action;;John Carpenter;;1996;;Kurt Russell,Stacy Keach,Steve Buscemi,Cliff Robertson,Peter Fonda,Georges Corraface,Michelle Forbes,Valeria Golino,Bruce Campbell,A.J.

Fahrenheit 9/11;;70;;82;;R;;Michael Moore's political documentary uses humor and connect-the-dots investigative journalism to question the Bush administration's motives for wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The film argues that President George W. Bush and his inner circle used the media to further an agenda that exploited the 9/11 attacks. The close ties of the Saudis to the Bush family, the cynical profiteering of corporations and a political elite beholden to special interests are all cited as elements of a corrupt system.;;Documentary;;Michael Moore;;2004;;Michael Moore,Ben Affleck,Stevie Wonder,George W.

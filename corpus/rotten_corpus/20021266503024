In their 2 1/2 year existence, The Cockettes created 20 shows, and were featured in 4 films. They created a unique burst of cultural experimentation and artistic outrageousness that continues to influence the worlds of theater, music, fashion, gay politics and spirituality, and urban club life.;;Documentary;;Bill Weber,David Weissman;;2002;;Rumi,Anton Dunnigan,Anton Koldewyn,Dusty Dawn,John Flowers,Goldie Glitters,Fayette Hauser,Ocean Michael Moon,Marshall Olds,Sweet Pam,Kreemah Ritz;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/cockettes

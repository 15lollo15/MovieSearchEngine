Whale Rider;;88;;91;;PG-13;;Only males are allowed to ascend to chiefdom in a Maori tribe in New Zealand. This ancient custom is upset when the child selected to be the next chief dies at birth. However his twin sister, Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes), survives. At age 12, she enlists the help of her grandmother (Vicky Haughton) and the training of her uncle (Grant Roa) to claim her birthright. But to break with convention, she'll have to do the impossible: win over her ultra-traditional grandfather (Rawiri Paratene).;;Drama,Kids & family;;Niki Caro;;2003;;Keisha Castle-Hughes,Rawiri Paratene,Vicky Haughton,Cliff Curtis,Grant Roa,Mana Taumaunu,Rachel House,Taungaroa Emile,Tammy Davis,Mabel Wharekawa,Rawinia Clarke,Tahei Simpson,Tyronne White;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/whale_rider

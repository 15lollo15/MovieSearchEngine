Fearless;;80;;85;;R;;When Max Klein (Jeff Bridges) survives a plane crash that kills many others, his last-minute epiphanies bring him a sense of invulnerability, leading to radical behavior. Instead of contacting his wife (Isabella Rossellini) after the crash, he sets off on a trip to see his old girlfriend, eats foods he was allergic to previously, and is strangely unafraid to fly again. Can a psychologist (John Turturro) and a fellow guilt-ridden survivor (Rosie Perez) help bring him down to earth?;;Drama;;Peter Weir;;1993;;Jeff Bridges,Isabella Rossellini,Rosie Perez,Tom Hulce,John Turturro,Benicio Del Toro,Deirdre O'Connell,John de Lancie,Spencer Vrooman,Daniel Cerny,Eve Roberts;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1046151-fearless

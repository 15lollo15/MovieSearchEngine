The Visitor;;84;;90;;PG-13;;When professor Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) travels to New York for a lecture, he's stunned to find illegal immigrants Tarek (Haaz Sleiman) and Zainab (Danai Gurira) living in his apartment. It comes out that it was rented to them by a swindler, and Vale feels sufficiently sorry for them that he invites them to stay. They get on well until Tarek is accused of jumping a subway turnstile and lands in a detention center. He risks being deported, and Vale does everything he can to prevent it.;;Drama;;Tom McCarthy;;2007;;Richard Jenkins,Hiam Abbass,Haaz Sleiman,Danai Gurira,Maggie Moore,Waleed Zuaiter,Amir Arison,Tzahi Moskovitz,Laith Nakli;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008820-visitor

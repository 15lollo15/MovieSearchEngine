Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer;;73;;86;;R;;British documentarian Nick Broomfield creates a follow-up piece to his 1992 documentary of the serial killer Aileen Wuornos, a highway prostitute who was convicted of killing six men in Florida between 1989 and 1990. Interviewing an increasingly mentally unstable Wuornos, Broomfield captures the distorted mind of a murderer whom the state of Florida deems of sound mind -- and therefore fit to execute. Throughout the film, Broomfield includes footage of his testimony at Wuornos' trial.;;Documentary;;Nick Broomfield,Joan Churchill;;2003;;Nick Broomfield,Aileen Wuornos;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/aileen_life_and_death_of_a_serial_killer

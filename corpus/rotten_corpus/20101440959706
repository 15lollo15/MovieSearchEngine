The Illusionist;;79;;90;;PG;;Magic tricks can't compete with rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, so a French illusionist (Jean-Claude Donda) finds himself touring Scotland's shabby pubs and run-down restaurants. But things brighten for him when he meets Alice (Eilidh Rankin), a girl who believes his powers are real. Together they travel to Edinburgh for a performance, but he doesn't have the heart to reveal that his feats are merely tricks, and risks financial ruin by giving her gifts supplied by his "magic.";;Drama,Animation;;Sylvain Chomet;;2010;;Jean-Claude Donda,Eilidh Rankin,Duncan MacNeil,Raymond Mearns,James T.

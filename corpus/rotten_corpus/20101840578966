City Island;;79;;82;;PG-13;;Prison guard Vince Rizzo (Andy Garcia) wants to quit his job to become an actor, but he also needs to make up for lost time with Tony (Steven Strait), a long lost son who's an inmate where Vince works. When Tony is freed, Vince suggests the ex-convict move in with his wife, Joyce (Julianna Margulies), and their children. But because Vince neglects to tell his family that Tony is not just a stranger, but the son he fathered before he met Joyce, this leads to a series of comic misunderstandings.;;Comedy;;Raymond De Felitta;;2010;;Andy Garcia,Julianna Margulies,Steven Strait,Emily Mortimer,Ezra Miller,Dominik Garc√≠a-Lorido,Carrie Baker Reynolds,Hope Glendon-Ross,Alan Arkin,Louis Mustillo,Jee Young Han;;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/city_island

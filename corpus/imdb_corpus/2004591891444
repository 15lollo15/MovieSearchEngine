The movie has been updated from the Korean War era to the war in Iraq (Desert Storm). Captain Bennett Marco (Denzel Washington) is now playing Frank Sinatra's part. Time has passed, and now Major Marco is giving speeches about his platoon being ambushed in the Kuwaiti desert. The Lost Platoon was saved by the heroics of Sergeant Raymond Prentiss Shaw (Liev Schreiber), who received the Medal of Honor. Shaw is now a candidate, running for Vice-President of the United States. Marco can't sleep at night, and when he does, he is having nightmares of what really happened in the desert. He thinks Shaw might not be a hero, and that he may have had something to do with the death of two soldiers in the desert. Marco tries to find the truth and people around him begin to die. <br><br>Douglas Young (the-movie-guy);;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0368008/

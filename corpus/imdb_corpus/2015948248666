With their well-funded bravado, scientists like the long-lasting Henry Wu, move to create more terrifying and deadly creatures. When a new species, the Indominus Rex, is created everything goes awry. Claire Dearing, the organized director of the new and refurbished Jurassic World theme park, seeks out the one hope they have, the bungalow-residing Owen Grady. Two children, Zach and Gray, nephews of Ms Dearing, plan to have a nice visit to the park without their parents. Things break loose into immense danger when they encounter the Indominus Rex on board an attraction, the Gyrosphere. While the tourists take refuge, the Indominous still roams disappointed at the loss of its hopeful meal of two kids and a duo of ex's trailing not far behind searching for the children. A man named Hoskins, an employee for the raptor foundation yearns for them one of the agile, smart, killing animals to be converted into bloodthirsty war machines. Trying to take them into his own grasp, he strikes a deal with the once noble Dr Wu and brings in a battalion of his followers to ship them up. Balancing the fate of her sister's kids, the safety and customers of the park, the new breed, and the naive dinosaur seller, Claire and Owen must solve everything before Jurassic Park like its predecessor, dissolves into history.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0369610/

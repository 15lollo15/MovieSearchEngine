Christopher Sullivan,Kimberly Neville,Cleveland O'Neal III,Roger Michelson,Joe Hanna;;Lloyd Fellowes (Sir Michael Caine), the director of an eccentric theatre company, is desperately trying to get his production together, despite the worst efforts of the cast, crew, and Lady Luck. We follow the production from final rehearsals through opening night, and onto the tour. As with any group of actors forced to work closely together for any great length of time, romances and arguments are bound to break out. Quite often, what's happening on stage is nothing compared to what's happening backstage.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105017/

But a series of events beyond their wildest dreams leads to a raucously funny reunion filled with gypsy mobsters, dirty deals and shotgun weddings. After Matko, Grga's low-life son, botches a train robbery and is double-crossed into debt, he is obliged to force his son into an arranged marriage to one of Zarije's kin. As the wedding day approaches - highlighted by the long anticipated reunion between Grga and Zarije - family and friends must cope with betrayals, lust, mishaps, death, farm animals and, ultimately, the pursuit of true love and enduring friendship.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118843/

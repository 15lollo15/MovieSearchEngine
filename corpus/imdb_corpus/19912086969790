He meets Katharina Hartmann (Barbara Sukowa), the daughter of the railroad owner and they fall in love. The Nazi sympathizers remaining in Europe coerce Kessler into cooperating with them to carry out terrorist tactic against the American forces attempting to govern the country, but Kesslers inability to perform brings about a realization about his place and Americas role in Germany.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101829/

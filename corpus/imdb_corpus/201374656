In a forest where he used to cut down trees, he meets Gary, a 15-year-old boy, and his father, Wade, an alcoholic bum. For Gary, all is not lost; there is still time for him to take the right path, as long as he escapes from the negative influence of his father. Joe takes Gary's side and, against all odds, the two of them eventually sympathize. The road to redemption in a small southern town is filled with lonely evenings, sweaty work, raw beers and wild guns.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2382396/

Bound together by a painful shared family history, they must find a way to break free in order to survive. The feelings the young man entertains for his sister overreach socially accepted norms. Anka herself is somewhat emotionally unstable, floundering as she is in a less than joyous relationship with Andrzej, the leader of a local neo-Nazi group; she dreams of a better future. This formidable debut fearlessly yet tenderly explores one of society's last taboos.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1927068/

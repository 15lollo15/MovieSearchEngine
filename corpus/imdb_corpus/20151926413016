Under those circumstances, when an innocent game of truth or dare on a Saturday night party rapidly transforms into a mandatory, dare only, series of sexy challenges between friends, the means to unfold one's true self, and the hidden potential in everyone present will be evident. Before long, alcohol and a few drugs will give birth to the new "Bang Gang" revolution; nevertheless, what deceptively appears as a way to deal with boredom, strained family relationships, emancipation--and above all--personal liberty, will quickly turn into the biggest scandal, and a mockery of a modern fairy tale.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3838728/

Rebels of the Neon God;;1992;;Not Rated;;Crime,Drama;;7.6;;Ming-liang Tsai;;Chao-jung Chen,Chang-Bin Jen,Kang-sheng Lee,Yi-Ching Lu,Tien Miao,Yu-Wen Wang;;Tsai Ming-liang's debut feature film already includes a handful of elements familiar to fans of subsequent work: a deceptively spare style often branded minimalist; actor Lee Kang-sheng as the silent and sullen Hsiao-kang; copious amounts of water, whether pouring from the sky or bubbling up from a clogged drain; and enough urban anomie to ensure that even the subtle humor in evidence is tinged with pathos. The loosely structured plot involves Hsiao-kang, a despondent cram school student, who becomes obsessed with young petty thief Ah-tze, after Ah-tze smashes the rearview mirror of a taxi driven by Hsiao-kangs father. Hsiao-kang stalks Ah-tze and his buddy Ah-ping as they hang out in the films iconic arcade (featuring a telling poster of James Dean on the wall) and other locales around Taipei, and ultimately takes his revenge.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103935/

As this urge grows stronger by the day, Diana will ultimately yield to her carnal longings, and through a parade of particularly explicit nocturnal sensual adventures, she will utterly embrace passion, even if this comes by way of transgression. However, before long, the unaware husband, Paolo, will find all about his headstrong and disobedient wife's extra-marital escapades, raunchy experiences vividly retold by Diana's very lips, with the intention to rekindle their love and spice up their sexual life. Inevitably, poor Paolo disgraced, enraged and green with jealousy (or could it be envy?), will threaten to move out leaving for good his liberated and adulterous wife who seems to feel no contrition at all. But how can Diana make Paolo understand her sincere motive to attract his attention when all she ever wanted was to add a dash of spice in their marriage?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104014/

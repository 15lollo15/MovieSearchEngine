DCP D'Silva (Boman Irani) and Detective Malik (Om Puri) are two cops who will do anything to capture Don. Don soon brutally murders one of his own men Ramesh (Diwakar Pundir) as well as his fiance Kamini (Kareena Kapoor). By doing so, Don makes an enemy out of Ramesh's sister Roma (Priyanka Chopra) who swears to kill Don no matter what it takes. Don is soon injured in a police pursuit and is admitted to hospital in a coma. D'Silva tracks down a look alike of Don named Vijay (also Shahrukh Khan). He persuades Vijay to enter Don's gang posing as Don. Vijay agrees to hand over a disc to D'Silva, a disc which contains vital information about the gang - this disc may be a way for the cops to arrest the gang. Roma attempts to kill Vijay, but stops when she learns about D'Silva's plan. During a police raid, Vijay and the gang members are all arrested by Malik. During the raid, D'Silva is killed. This causes problems for Vijay - D'Silva was the only person who could prove Vijay is not the real Don. Will Vijay be able to prove his innocence?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0461936/

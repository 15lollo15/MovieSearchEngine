Free Jr.;;(this was first posted on www.realmoviereview.com) The story, which is based on Jim Stovalls novel of the same name, is manipulative (big surprise there), but is fairly engaging once it gets going.<br><br>Drew Fullers inexperience shows itself from time to time, as he plays Jason Stevens, the spoiled grandson of a deceased billionaire whose expectations from the will are put off while he is led through several tasks designed to make him a better person. Along the way, he meets and befriends a young girl named Emily, played by Abigail Breslin just before Little Miss Sunshine hit the theatres and made her a big star. Her mother, Alexia, played by Ali Hillis. The production values here are Hollywood quality, though both the script and the acting could have been improved.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0482629/

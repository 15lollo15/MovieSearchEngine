Phillip,Ilario Bisi-Pedro;;Charlie Price grew up with his father in the family shoe business, but he never thought he'd take his father's place. But his father's untimely death places him exactly there, where he learns that Price and Sons Shoes is failing. While in despair at his failed attempts to save the business, Charlie has a chance encounter with flamboyant drag queen cabaret singer Lola. Her complaints about the inadequate footwear for her work, combined with the suggestion of one of Charlie's ex-employees, Lauren, lead to a bid to save the business by making men's fetish footwear. Charlie convinces Lola to be their footwear designer and the transition begins. Now this disparate lot must struggle with this unorthodox idea while dealing with the prejudice of the staff, Lola's discomfort in the small town, and the selfish manipulation of Charles' greedy fiancee, who cannot see the greater good in Charlie's dream.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434124/

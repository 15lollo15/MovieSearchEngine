Then she meets Adam (Paul Rudd) , an attractive, spontaneously funny, single, 29-year-old actor at an audition. She successfully casts him, which revives the show's ratings. She also dates him, but her pathological insecurity, focused on their age difference, compromises the relationship. That culminates when she suspects him of infidelity with the show's star, and the studio gives those two their own sitcom.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0466839/

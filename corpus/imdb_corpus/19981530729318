The gun he gets, thrown in by Sheldon Blake, proves disabled, and for a sinister reason: near Borneo, Blake's men turn up to capture them. The family escapes but loses the yacht on a reef. They build a cool camp on an island. But the pirates keep coming back, and the boys discover why: he hid a treasure in the yacht. Shane is also discovered and captured in more than one way by French plane-wreck survivor Françoise, who later teams up with the family.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0130142/

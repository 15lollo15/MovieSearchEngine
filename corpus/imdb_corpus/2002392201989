Porter,Li Hagman,Jerry Collins;;Jerry and Nick are two best buddies whose love lives have hit rock bottom, Jerry's especially, having just vomited all over his fianc√©e on a hot air balloon trip prior to proposing to her. To escape their troubles and find women, they book a trip on-board a cruiseliner, unaware the travel agent has just played a horrid trick on them in retaliation for Nick offending his secret gay lover. And that's the trick; it's a gay cruiseliner for gay men to meet and mingle. Slowly but surely, the two main characters begin to realize this and in turn get into a lot of humorous predicaments.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0285462/

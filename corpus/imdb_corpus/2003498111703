In addition to exploring some sadistic and Oedipal issues, he acts with a complete disregard for anyone else's situation or feelings; starting with his former girlfriend. Her story is told in flashbacks throughout the film. Just after he takes a job as a helper on a cargo boat in England, he and his boss find a woman's body floating in the canal. We see his personality unfold as he boldly seduces the plain, frustrated wife of a ferryman who takes him in to live with them, as he works for them on their boat.. Plenty of lust and nudity to illustrate his choices.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0289635/

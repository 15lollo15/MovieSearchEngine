The Indian Runner;;1991;;R;;Drama;;7.0;;Sean Penn;;David Morse,Viggo Mortensen,Valeria Golino,Patricia Arquette,Charles Bronson,Sandy Dennis,Dennis Hopper,Jordan Rhodes,Enzo Rossi,Harry Crews,Eileen Ryan,Trevor Endicott,Brandon Fleck,Kathy Jensen,James Devney,Leland J. Olson,Annie Pearson,Thomas Blair Levin;;Reminiscent of Richman Poorman, this movie plays like a greek tradgedy with no happy endings. A tale of two brothers that fill stereotypical roles of one brother favored with a half full indulgent take on life balanced with a younger brother that radiates impending doom. Tough and often wrong decisions pepper this movie and lead the viewer to believe for a moment it might be possible for a happy ending. A final decision at the end of the movie leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. Opinion: Eric Roberts would have been perfect for the role of 'the indian runner'.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102116/

'Memory', one of its many classic songs, became an instant worldwide hit. Since then CATS has smashed records and conquered the world. Using the latest technology, all the excitement, thrill, romance and intimacy of this theatrical legend has been captured on screen. Breathtaking visuals and full digital sound (that has been completely re-recorded with a seventy piece orchestra) will leave you deep into the mysterious world of CATS as you've never seen it before - more intoxicating and magical than you could possibly imagine. With a star cast including Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0173714/

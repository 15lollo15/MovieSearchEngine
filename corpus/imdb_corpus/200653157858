Despite the fine teaching by excellent professionals like Mrs. Dorothy Lintott (Frances de la Tour) in history and the intellectually enthusiastic Mr. Hector (Richard Griffiths) in General Studies, the Headmaster (Clive Merrison) is not satisfied. He signs on the young Irwin (Stephen Campbell Moore) to polish the students' style to give them the best chance. In this mix of intellectualism and creative spirit that guides a rigorous preparation regime for that ultimate educational brass ring, the lives of the randy students and the ostensibly restrained faculty intertwine that would change their lives forever.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0464049/

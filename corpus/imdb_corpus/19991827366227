Pivoting around the complex and timeless subject of human relationships and the delicate intricacies of sexual desire, unsuspecting, and utterly unprotected, characters--ranging from repressed housewives to insecure careerists to gay-curious straight men--become entangled in one big erotic mess with unforeseen complications. Sex is everywhere, and through the magnifying glass of intimacy's dazzling kaleidoscope, there's always a little bit of something for everyone. Under those steamy circumstances, is there such a thing as "Safe Sex"?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220016/

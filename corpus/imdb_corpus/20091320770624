Howard. A 17th century Puritan, Solomon Kane is a somber-looking man who wanders the world with no apparent goal other than to vanquish evil in all its forms. His adventures, published mostly in the pulp magazine Weird Tales, often take him from Europe to the jungles of Africa and back.<br><br>Once a mercenary of Queen Elizabeth I fighting Spainards in Africa, He met the Devil's Reaper and discovered he was bound for hell. Barely escaping, he soon renounced violence to atone for his past sins, seeking out redemption in a life of peace. That is until the followers of a priest turned sorcerer, Malachi, kidnap a Purtian girl, Meredith Crowthorn, and brutally slaughter her family before his very own eyes; forcing Solomon to take up arms and return to his violent ways once more to rescue her.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0970452/

Miller) puts a dramatic end to their wedding. When the furious bride decides to take her Baja honeymoon solo, Nardo follows her-where the lovesick groom is carjacked and left stranded, naked and penniless in a remote part of the Mexican desert. Helpless, Nardo sends out an SOS to Jason and their pal Evan (Adam Pally), an up-and-coming ad exec slated for an important business meeting the next morning. During their ridiculous attempt to rescue Nardo, the trio embarks on a series of increasingly outrageous misadventures involving con artists, drug smugglers and even the Federales.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2758904/

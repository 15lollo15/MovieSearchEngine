Cuba Gooding Jr. plays Darrin Hill, an advertising junior executive who is trying to make it big in New York City and a corner office. He finally makes a big ad pitch and is on his way up the corporate ladder; unfortunately, he is fired for misrepresenting his Yale education. He receives a letter informing him that his Aunt Sally has died in his hometown of Monte Carlo, Georgia. Since he is unemployed and broke, he takes a train back home to attend her funeral. As Sally's only living relative, Darrin receives an inheritance of stock worth $150,000. However, to get the money, Darrin must fulfill her last wish, which is to form a gospel choir for the Beulah Baptist Church and take it to the annual Gospel Explosion competition. Darrin tells the preacher that he is a music producer in New York City, and he can build a great choir. There is only one problem, everybody who comes in for auditions are really bad singers. Darrin needs a miracle if he has any chance at all. Then Darrin finds Lilly, played by Beyonce Knowles, who is a beautiful nightclub singer with the voice of an angel. He finds other singers at the barbershop and the prison. After putting together a beautiful sounding choir, Darrin is now ready for the competition. The cast is loaded with singing stars such as: Shirley Caesar, Faith Evans, Angie Stone, Melba Moore, Ann Nesby, The O'Jays, Montell Jordan, T-Bone, Zane, and many others.

Glen, the orphan doll offspring of the irrepressible devilish-doll-come-to-life Chucky and his equally twisted bride Tiffany. When production starts on a movie detailing the urban legend of his parents' lethal exploits, Glen heads for Hollywood where he brings his bloodthirsty parents back from the dead. Although Glen - or is it Glenda? - is immediately accepted, the family dynamics are far from perfect. Chucky and Tiffany go Hollywood and get rolling on a new spree of murderous mayhem, much to gentle Glen's dismay. Chucky can't believe that his son doesn't want to walk in his murdering footsteps, while star-struck Tiffany can't believe that the movie will star her favorite actress, Jennifer Tilly, who soon becomes an unwitting hostess to this new family in more ways than one.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387575/

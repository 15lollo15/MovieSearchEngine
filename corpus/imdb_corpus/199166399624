Volunteering to drive the woman's son home to Chicago for Thanksgiving from his Georgia boarding school, Dutch doesn't expect a picaresque adventure with an insufferable 12-year-old snob (desperately insecure under the surface) who disapproves of him totally. Can they reach their destination as friends? Will they get home at all?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101786/

While on a night out with a friend, the guileless eighteen-year-old Korean-American, Hyun Jae, finds herself drugged, tape-gagged, and kidnapped after accepting a drink from a perfect stranger at a bar. Now, a new name and an ugly reality await the hapless girl, who is kept alive to serve one purpose only: to have sex with strangers. As Hyun Jae is dragged into a cruel, pitiless world of prostitution and violence, frequented by corrupt policemen, addicts and drug dealers, the resilient teenage captive must do everything in her power to stay alive. However, is there an escape from the dark den of sin?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1734433/

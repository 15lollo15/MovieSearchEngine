They have discovered that this one test will determine their future, and the college that will admit them. Each student has his or her own reasons for deciding to become criminals and beat the system. They have justified their act by concluding that the test is unfair and discriminates against them; therefore, it is ok to steal the test. Lucky for them, the father of one in the group owns the building where the testing company is located. This student gets the building plans, and she also has a door card key. Their lives change with this one act, maybe for the better. Douglas Young (the-movie-guy);;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0314498/

Robin is a quirky real estate agent looking for a ride-share to accompany her to Los Angeles. Her advertisement is answered by Jane, who at first was uncertain about her. A stop in Pittsburgh picks up a third, Holly, escaping a violent and drug dealing partner. Girls on the road, reaching understanding, respect, and care for each other. But this trio is different - Jane a lesbian, Robin suffering with AIDS, Holly running from her past, seeking one night stands, and a good man.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112571/

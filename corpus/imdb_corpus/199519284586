He is good enough at baseball to make the pros, but he needs a real education to have something to fall back on. He is studying sports medicine and Melissa, a spoiled rich girl who he happens to meet at a party, turns out to be the teaching assistant in a class he has to take. And she ends up tutoring him. And more. Doug and Melissa get a little too close and that could affect his relationship with Laura, an aspiring journalist who has been accepted to Stanford. That's a long way from wherever Doug's university is. Early in the movie, Doug almost did something very inappropriate with Laura in the college library. Later, Doug tries to make it work with Laura, but she is feeling ignored and there's a chance things might not work out. But Laura is quite reasonable in her concerns. Melissa won't accept that she can't have Doug and she turns into a stalker. In fact, her behavior turns very disturbing. Doug starts getting distracted and that could affect his future. Doug lost his father and his mother is still having a hard time getting over the loss. Melissa had a much more complicated relationship with her allegedly abusive parents. Is there something the viewer is not seeing? Or is the viewer seeing something that's just not there? Laura puts her investigative skills to work, but both she and Doug's mother may be in danger. And just when it appears the Melissa problem has been solved - surprise.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113748/

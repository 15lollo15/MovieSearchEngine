One day, he goes to a hardware store where he meets attractive middle-aged widow Carissa, who convinces him to come fix the shower at her house. She seduces him and they have sex. When he comes under the spell of this rapacious, manipulative woman, he lands between two strong, unreasonable women--one of whom is insane.

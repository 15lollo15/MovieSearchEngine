Mad with grief and vowing revenge, he meets an enigmatic cult leader named M (Andrew Divoff - Wishmaster) who offers him all the power he needs to get payback. The Price? His immortal soul. Reborn as the demon FAUST, Jaspers is soon on his vengeance trail. But his hellish alter ego is totally out of control. All it wants to do is kill and it's not satisfied by a few criminals. As the bodies mount up, Jaspers finds himself pursued on two sides, by determined cop Margolies (Jeffrey Combs - Reanimator, The Frighteners) and M, who has his own sinister plans for the demonic avenger. And so the stage is set for the ultimate battle between good and evil.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0223268/

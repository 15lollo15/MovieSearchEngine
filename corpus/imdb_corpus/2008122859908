The clever and original premise finds a number of high-school students taking a sex-education class taught by an over-friendly teacher trying to make kids comfortable about an uncomfortable subject. Each students has his or her own take on early sexual experiences, making Extreme Movie a bundle of sketches starring a few familiar faces. Frank Muniz (Malcolm In the Middle) begins the comedy as a lucky guy who talks his girlfriend into going all the way, and then finds there's no limit to her fetishistic cravings. Michael Cera (Superbad) plays a computer nerd who meets a hot girl online and sets up a meeting with her, but ends up in the wrong place accidentally terrifying a middle-aged woman (who beats him with a broom). Other bits involve sex with Abraham Lincoln, sex with a Muppets-like character, and the travails of a horny teen (Ryan Pinkston) whose shyness is tested when he accidentally ends up in a porn movie production. Matthew Lillard plays himself dispensing crude advice to guys everywhere.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0806147/

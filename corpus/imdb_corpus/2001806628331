He quickly picks up the sinful way of life of his stepfather, Khun Luang who married his mother after she became pregnant from being raped. His 'father's' mistress, Mrs. Boonlueang welcomes the young boy into her literal bosom. Wanting badly to know his real father, he leaves the house, only coming back after his stepfather's daughter falls pregnant out of wedlock. He does a favor to his stepfather by marrying her, even though he is deeply in love with his mistress. The truth about his birth, as he will later learn, is as confusing and messed up as his present life and the lives of those around him.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0282628/

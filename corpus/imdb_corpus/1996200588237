Peterson<br><br>This a very good movie with Jean Claude Van Damme as the hero triumphing against all odds. Van Damme also directed and did a very fine job. It's like a synthesis of Indiana Jones with Bloodsport. The story is set in the 1920s and the tournament is not the Kumite, but an equivalent called the Ghang-gheng. The script is actually based upon an amended version of the Bloodsport story which never got produced. The pageantry here is greater. Really exotic settings with a more spectacular tournament venue. More diverse ethnicity via costume. I don't know enough about any of this to comment upon authenticity. For some reason I enjoyed this movie much more the second time I saw it.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117420/

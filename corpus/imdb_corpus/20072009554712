Leto is frightfully good. Very good acting all round.This movie was clear and made me sit up and listen to every word.I was happy to see that Yoko did not attribute to this movie,she has enough grief to handle.I just kept on thinking about the loss and my grief too.This movie did not glorify Chapman but what it did was it gave me some kind of understanding.There should be a followup to this so we can see how that Chapman loser fades away and thankfully dies.Lindsay lohan did a good job too.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0488988/

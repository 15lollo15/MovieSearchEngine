Marie, who's slight and diffident, quiet and nearly expressionless, is friends with Anne, who's a bit chunky and impulsive and has decided that François will be her first love. Watching synchronized swimming, Marie is suddenly attracted to the team captain Floriane--beautiful, aloof, tall, and rumored to be a slut. François pursues her and Marie begins to hang around her; they trade favors, and an odd friendship forms. Each experiences her own first, and Marie must sort out attraction and friendship.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0869977/

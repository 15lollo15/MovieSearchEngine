Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. As Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, flashbacks reveal--someone who is not quite of this world. In fact, he informs her that he's from the future: the year 2470. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him--and maybe fix him. He seems sane enough, but has he told her the real story? What is he up to? And who is Chrystie Delancey?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0208196/

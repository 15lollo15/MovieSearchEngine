According to his calculations founded on a numerical transcription of the Apocalypse, the birth is going to take place somewhere in the Spanish capital on Christmas Day; however, time is running up, and the good father needs to pinpoint the exact birthplace. Without delay--although uncertain on how to get started--Father Berriartúa teams up with the enthusiastic Black Metal aficionado, José María, and the Italian TV show host and connoisseur of the occult, Professor Caván. Now, the once-pious man must become an unrelenting sinner to foil the arch-enemy's plans. Is there still hope?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112922/

In the rare moments when they're not thinking about girls, Kevin dreams of being a singer and Perry aspires to be a dance-music DJ. When they manage to stop a bank robbery, they're given a sizable cash reward and decide to go on holiday to Ibiza, which is supposedly populated with thousands of beautiful women willing to sleep with anyone. Bu after the boys pack plenty of condoms and sunscreen, Kevin's parents announce that they're tagging along. Undeterred, Kevin and Perry make the trip and meet superstar DJ Eyeball Paul , who may or may not listen to their demo tape. The boys also encounter Gemma and Candice, two scruffy teenage girls who are nearly as eager as Kevin and Perry to get horizontal.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0205177/

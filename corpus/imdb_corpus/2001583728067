It seems the event is team-oriented, and the only suitable local contestants had a huge falling out a decade ago .<br><br>For Brian (<a href="/name/nm0001326/">Josh Hartnett</a>), the son of two hairdressers, that falling out had personal consequences: His mother Shelley (<a href="/name/nm0001670/">Natasha Richardson</a>) left his father Phil (<a href="/name/nm0000614/">Alan Rickman</a>) to take up with Phil's hair model Sandra (<a href="/name/nm0341737/">Rachel Griffiths</a>). Since then, former styling champ Phil has settled for training Brian to help run his lowly barber shop, while Shelley and Sandra have opened a salon of their own. But when Shelley learns that she has terminal cancer, she reaches out to her family in hopes that a reunion for the hairdressing contest might help them all find some sense of closure.<br><br>To complicate matters, Phil's old arch-nemesis, Ray (<a href="/name/nm0631490/">Bill Nighy</a>), is now a two-time champ looking for a three-peat, and he's brought along his beautiful American daughter Christina (<a href="/name/nm0000337/">Rachael Leigh Cook</a>) to work on his team.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212380/

She's reached the end of her rope, and is more than happy to hole up, seal up, and resign herself to a life alone.<br><br>That is until Jack (Simon Pegg) mistakes Nancy for his blind date under the clock at Waterloo Station, and she does the unthinkable and just goes with it. Because what if pretending to be someone else finally makes her man up, and become her painfully honest, awesomely unconventional, and slightly unstable true self?<br><br>Best just to let the evening unfold, roll with the consequences, and see if one unpredictable, complicated, rather unique night can bring these two messy souls together. Man Up is an honest, heartwarming screwball of a rom-com. A film about putting yourself out there, taking chances, and keeping a hold on that ever-diminishing glimmer of hope, no matter the shit life throws at you.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3064298/

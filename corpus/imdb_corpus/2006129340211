Lady Chatterley;;2006;;R;;Drama,Romance;;6.7;;Pascale Ferran;;Marina Hands,Jean-Louis Coulloc'h,Hippolyte Girardot,Hélène Alexandridis,Hélène Fillières,Bernard Verley,Sava Lolov,Jean-Baptiste Montagut,Fanny Deleuze,Michel Vincent,Colette Philippe,Christelle Hes,Jade Bouchard,Joël Vandael,Jacques De Bock,Jean-Claude Leclère,Ninon Brétécher,Léopold Canou;;A woman of means, played by the transcendent Marina Hands, begins an affair with the gamekeeper on her husband's estate, opening herself up physically and emotionally in ways she never imagined possible. There is something electrifying and thrilling about Ferran's handling of the material, as nearly every frame is imbued with the tension and energy of discovery, of characters pushing the boundaries of their worlds and breaking through to new levels of self-understanding. At the same time, the action is overseen throughout by Ferran's frequent use of lovingly shot scenes of natureleaves, water, fields of waving grassto provide a contrast to the world of politesse and decorum. While the film grapples with emotions in turmoil and the sensual world that grows outside the door of society's rigid structures, there is also a sense that things are the way they should be, as Lady Chatterley undergoes a spiritual awakening and rebirth.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0459880/

Even though most of the deleted original footage was presumed lost, unexpectedly, VHS tapes containing the supposedly lost raw footage have been discovered. Blatty's Director's Cut, Legion, was released in October 2016, adding new scenes and inserts taken from the recovered VHS, an alternative opening scene, and a different exorcism ending to the Theatrical Cut, among many other differences. The result is considered to be closer to the original screenplay, encompassing Blatty's original vision.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt10045260/

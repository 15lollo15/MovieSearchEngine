Shot mostly within a very constricted space, the story follows an older, celebrated journalist Miguel (José Sacristán) who meets the beautiful and coy journalism-student Angela (María Valverde) to give an interview - but becomes intent upon seducing her. They end up naked in a bathroom, discussing literature, prose and career trajectories ...gradually divulging little insights into their own selves as the audience starts to understand the old journalist's cynicism and the young protegé's intentions.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1760980/

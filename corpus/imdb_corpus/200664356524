Macy,Svetlana Metkina;;Tuesday, June 4, 1968: the California Presidential primary. As day breaks, <a class="ipc-md-link ipc-md-link--entity" href="/name/nm0448305/">Robert F. Kennedy</a> arrives at the Ambassador Hotel. He'll campaign, then speak to supporters at midnight. To capture the texture of the late 1960s, we see vignettes at the hotel: a couple marries so he can avoid Vietnam, kitchen staff discuss race and baseball, a man cheats on his wife, another is fired for racism, a retired hotel doorman plays chess in the lobby with an old friend, a campaign strategist's wife needs a pair of black shoes, two campaign staff trip on LSD, a lounge singer is on the downhill slide. Through it all, we see and hear R.F.K. calling for a better society and a better nation.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0308055/

In 1976, Napa Valley wines have not yet earned respect. Jim's son Bo does not seem very ambitious, although the father and son do enjoy boxing.<br><br>In Paris, Maurice, who sounds American, tells Steven Spurrier his wine shop needs more variety. Too many of the wines are French. But of course they are, because Steven, despite being British, is a wine snob who thinks only French wines are worth selling. But after some persuasion, Steven decides to see if wines from California are really any good.<br><br>Back in Napa Valley, Sam arrives in a beat-up Volkswagen to start work as the vineyard's new intern. She is quite pretty and Bo is all too eager to show her around town. Gustavo comes with them and Bo gets in a fight with a racist trucker who thinks "Chico" should be his servant. They go to a bar run by Joe, a tough female bartender who took over from her father Joe. There, Bo challenges the people in the bar to bet that Gustavo can't identify wines in covered bottles by type and vintage. This is, of course, a scam.<br><br>Jim is not as successful as he appears. He can't get a loan from the bank and it is later revealed he is so broke he can't put gas in his truck.<br><br>Jim encounters Steven, whose AMC Gremlin has a flat tire. He helps Steven. Steven later arrives at Chateau Montelena and tries the wines. He is impressed enough that he wants to enter wines from this area in a contest back in Paris.<br><br>Bo continues to show rebellious behavior and his father insists he turn his life around, possibly by going to college--on a scholarship because Jim certainly can't afford to send him--or get out.<br><br>Jim also fires Gustavo because he knows Gustavo has been running his own wine operation, meaning he can't devote his entire attention to Jim's business. Gustavo, who is fulfilling the dream of his immigrant father who was only a field hand, is not ready to be on his own yet. However, he does visit Sam at her cabin, which leads to more of a romantic relationship, even though Bo is also interested. And when Bo shows up, Gustavo and Sam are together and Bo is mad.<br><br>When Steven returns to Paris, he has bottles of Jim's wine that Bo has sneaked into his luggage.<br><br>Back in California, Jim is upset because his wine has turned brown. 500 cases worth. He is finished. And he throws Bo out. But the wine tastes fine so Bo and Sam go to a wine expert to find out what happened. Professor Saunders of UC-Davis (based on the road sign) assures them that because Jim's process was so perfect, this was likely to happen. Because perfection with Jim's process is nearly impossible. The wines will return to their normal color.<br><br>Bo has to contact Jim, but there is another problem. Jim got someone to dispose of all the bottles. Meanwhile, Jim has returned to his old workplace. Bill assures him the partners want him back, but not as a partner. Still, Jim hands Marge, a co-worker, one of the bad bottles of wine so she can have something to show him if he ever gets the desire to do something crazy again.<br><br>When Bo runs out of gas in his truck and no one will stop to help, Sam shows her breasts to the first driver to show up. It's a cop.<br><br>Thinking there is no hope, Bo and Sam go to Joe's bar and discover one of Jim's wine bottles. Joe says she got a really good deal. Someone showed up with a ton of these bottles and she bought them just to recycle the bottles. Jim's vineyard is saved. Bo does succeed in contacting Bill, who in turn hands the phone to Jim, who goes crazy and pours a glass of wine for everyone. .<br><br>Back at the vineyard, Jim gets the news that his wine will be entered in the competition in Paris. After all Bo has done, he sends Bo to represent the business. People in the area contribute to the cost of sending Bo. And Gustavo gets his old job back too.<br><br>Outside Paris, Bo arrives at the competition and Steven announces that American wines are being included for the first time as a way of honoring the U.S. Bicentennial and France's contribution to their independence. The judges are only given a number, and a trusted journalist is given the name of the business represented by each number. One wine stands out among all the rest, and Steven asks the journalist whose it is. Bo is told he needs to dress better if he is going to stay, so Bo changes clothes. Then the announcement is made that Chateau Montelena has won the competition.<br><br>Time magazine wants to do a story. People want this new wine from Napa Valley but can't get it. California wines are now among the top wines in the world.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0914797/

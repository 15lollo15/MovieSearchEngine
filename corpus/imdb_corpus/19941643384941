After nearly 20 years of service, he is being forced to retire on the pretext of his health and might not even be given a pension. The boys regard him as a Hitler, with some justification. His wife Laura (Greta Scacchi) is unfaithful, and lives to wound him any way she can. Andrew must come to terms with his failed life and regain at least his own self-respect.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109340/

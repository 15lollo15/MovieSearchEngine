Göran is not altogether in harmony with himself or his work situation and is trying a bit too hard to please everyone around him. Unlike his best friend, he is not prepared to compromise with love and settle for the less-than-perfect girl. In pursuit of love he sails out to a Midsummer party in the seductive Swedish archipelago. Unexpected love lurks in the bright Swedish summer's night, ready to rock the raft of romance. Comedy and romance are the main ingredients when a story unfolds about young urban self-conscious people in a high-society setting.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305869/

Umeh,Louis Mustillo;;A proud, born-and-bred Jersey girl, Stephanie, has plenty of attitude, even if she's been out of work for the last six months and just lost her car to a debt collector. Desperate for some fast cash, she turns to her last resort - convincing her sleazy cousin to give her a job at his bail bonding company as a recovery agent.<br><br>Stephanie takes on the company's most notorious bail-jumper, former vice cop and murder suspect Joe Morelli - the same Joe Morelli who happened to break her heart in high school. Nabbing Joe would be satisfying payback and a hefty paycheck. But as Stephanie learns the ins and outs of the business from hunky colleague Ranger, she also realizes that the case against Joe isn't airtight. With a plethora of misadventures along the way, Stephanie's new job isn't nearly as easy as she thought.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1598828/

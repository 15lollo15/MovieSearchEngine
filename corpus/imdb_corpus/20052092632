She's a self-described slut who doesn't see the value of marriage much less the point of weddings and wedding magazines. For her first issue, she tries edgy and iconoclastic. Can she pull it off? Meanwhile, the gulf between herself and her father impedes her work and her personal life, and her mistrust of commitment is tested by her involvement with a photographer named Hemingway and her interactions with Ian, her father's second-in-command. Is there a Mr. Darcy for this Miss Bennett, a Benedict for this Beatrice?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0413879/

For years they were in the same or separate homes or on the run together. Chloé is autistic; she doesn't talk, she feels panicked when touched, and eats only when told to do so. Joseph dearly loves her and firmly thinks she needs him; the child psychiatrist agrees that he has a very positive influence. Joseph dreams that Chloé will recover if they find their parents. The psychiatrist finds the mother, but she's also autistic. When the children were a year old she left them on the street just on an impulse. This is the first crack of Joseph's dream. The children escape from this home. The next time they're caught, Chloé is sent to a mental hospital; the same thing is about to happen to Joseph after he attempts suicide at the police station, but because of his friendship with the gang leader, many children liberate him on the way. With much violence they also liberate Chloé. Eventually Joseph robs a man of a thick wallet, causes a large traffic accident when successfully stealing a car, and plunges a knife into a police officer who shoots him, though not seriously. And Chloe, will she lose her fear of being touched?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0291131/

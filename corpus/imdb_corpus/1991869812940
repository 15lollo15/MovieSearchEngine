And, just like that, the once-innocent woman becomes Paprika, in high hopes of raising enough money to finance her good-for-nothing boyfriend. Before long, Paprika will learn to enjoy her disreputable but very profitable occupation, working her way up, one client at a time, as she journeys from one brothel to another in the bustling city of Rome. However, despite Paprika's stormy but prosperous voyage of self-discovery, experience, and sexual liberation, there is still one thing missing in her seemingly full life: unearthing the great mystery of true love. Is Paprika meant to experience a passionate romance?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098063/

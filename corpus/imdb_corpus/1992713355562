The source of the meat for the pies? Men who are passing through, lured to strange deaths by the nieces--Fawn, Coral, Sky, and Magnolia--who smile, show a little skin, and pretend to be playmates. Closing in on the trail of a missing man is New York private eye Harold Ivars; the town cop, Chief Koal, also finds Larry's behavior a bit suspicious. Will the cop and the dick bring Auntie Lee's vocation to a grinding halt?;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106323/

More than a century later, three Federal agents in the same forests are on a mission to bust a drug-manufacturing operation run by the ruthless criminal kingpin, Santiago, and his men; however, an unexpected complication will lead to their suspension. Out of sheer luck, the operatives unearth the hidden treasure while on vacation--and from that point on--trouble ensues, as Santiago along with a duplicitous corrupt agent and his deadly personal assassin, Jewel Panther, will hunt them down, one by one.

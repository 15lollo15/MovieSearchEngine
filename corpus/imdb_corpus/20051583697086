Lucía, a very pretentious mother, believes she controls everything in accordance with the requirements of the typical middle-class Argentinean way of life; she doesn't see that under her own roof Jeremias and Meme have a secret relationship. Ezequiel, the eldest brother, arrives from Spain to get married under his parents' pride-filled gaze. His presence, and that of Montse, his fiancée, is going to reveal the fragility of the seemingly perfect order of things. Love develops into sin, but its power resists set moral standards.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0366544/

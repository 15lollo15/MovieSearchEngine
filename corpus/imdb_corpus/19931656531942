In this second "symphony" of the Beethoven saga, our hero meets Missy, the lady Saint Bernard of his dreams. Unfortunately, they are soon separated by Regina, Missy's hateful owner who is using her as a bargaining chip in an ugly divorce. But love finds a way, and the result is four adorable, roly-poly puppies. The prospect of four valuable, purebred pups appeals to Regina's greed, but the Newton kids come to the rescue and bring home the cuddly canines. Now if they can just convince Dad to adopt the huge, messy bundles of joy . . . Mission accomplished. But Missy is still in Regina's evil clutches.

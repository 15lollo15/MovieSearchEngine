Pressure from Betsy's extended family to include their joint Jewish and Italian-Catholic heritage in the ceremony does little to assuage her worries, and then there's her older sister Connie; their parents assume she's still single because she has the audacity to pursue the unfeminine profession of police officer. With all of his funds tied up in the money pit of a house he's building, Betsy's dad must turn to his crooked brother-in-law Oscar for financial assistance, and soon a soft-spoken but menacing young mobster named Stevie Dee is supervising Eddie's construction project and casting his romantic aspirations toward the clueless Connie.;;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099128/
